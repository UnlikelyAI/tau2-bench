## Lloyds Bank Online Fixed Bond

## Lloyds Bank Online Fixed Bond conditions

Online Fixed Bond is a savings account for people wanting to save $£ 2,000$ - for a set length of time. It pays interest at a fixed rate over the term you choose. It's a restricted savings account - this affects how and when we tell you about any changes.

Variations of Online Fixed Bond may be available from time to time, depending how much you want to save and for how long. The account summary box and other introductory information will explain how to qualify for any variation. We've also included more detail in the Additional important information section. If you have one of these variations, and there's a difference between the conditions that apply to your variation and the rest of these Online Fixed Bond conditions, then the conditions for your variation will apply. Otherwise the rest of these Online Fixed Bond conditions will cover your account.

## Deposits

You can pay in by transfer from another account - use Internet Banking or call us. You can also pay in through one of our branches with a counter.

Please make sure you pay in the amount you want to save during the 10 days after you open your account. During this time you can pay in more than once, but after the first 10 days you can't add anymore.

Your fixed term starts on the day you open your account, even if you don't start saving straightaway.

## Interest

We pay fixed interest - this means your interest rate won't change while you have the account.
We pay interest annually, on the anniversary of account opening.
We transfer your interest to the account you chose when you opened your Online Fixed Bond.

## Account information

Normally we provide a statement when your account matures. We'll do this once a year as well, if you choose to save for 2, 3, 4 or 5 years.
You can also check your account using Internet Banking or our Mobile Banking app.

## Early closure

You can't withdraw part of your savings, but you can close your account early. Visit one of our branches with a counter to do this.
If you close before the end of the fixed term you will lose an amount equal to:

- 90 days' interest for a 1 year term;
- 180 days' interest for a 2 year term;
- 270 days' interest for a 3 year term;
- 320 days' interest for a 4 year term; or
- 365 days' interest for a 5 year term

We'll take this from your Online Fixed Bond savings before closing your account, so you may get back less than you first invested.

## Maturity

We'll get in touch before the end of your fixed term, to ask what you'd like to do with your savings.
If we don't get instructions in time, your account will automatically change to a Standard Saver. This will happen on the working day after your fixed term ends. After this, the Standard Saver interest rate and account conditions will apply.

You'll have instant access, and we'll send you full details before the change. If you keep your savings in Standard Saver, we'll take you as having agreed to the new account conditions.

# Bear in mind

You can't have any more than $£ 1,000,000$ in your Online Fixed Bond.
You also can't have any more than 5 Online Fixed Bonds with Lloyds Bank.
Our Online Fixed Bond savings terms may not all be available at the same time. These conditions apply whichever term you choose.
If your account changes to Standard Saver, your account number and sort code will stay the same.
The right to cancel doesn't apply to Online Fixed Bond.
You can open and service the Online Fixed Bond in branch, over the phone and online.
