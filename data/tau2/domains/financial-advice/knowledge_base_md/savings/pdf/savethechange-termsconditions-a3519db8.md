For use from 1 November 2022

# Lloyds Bank Save the Change conditions

You can switch on Save the Change ${ }^{\circledR}$ if you have a Lloyds Bank debit card with a Classic, Club Lloyds, Cash Account, Under 19s Account, Platinum, Gold Service, Silver, Premier, Basic Account, Graduate, Student, Club Lloyds Platinum, Club Lloyds Premier, Club Lloyds Gold, Club Lloyds Silver, Select, Classic Staff, Platinum Offset, Premier Offset, Gold Offset, Select Offset, Classic Offset, Student Account, Cheque Account and Smart Start Spending Account. Not all of these accounts are available to new customers, but if you already have one you will be able to set Save the Change up on it.
Most times you use your debit card to pay you can save the change.
You'll need an eligible savings account to save your change in to. Savings accounts eligible for Save the Change are Easy Saver, Standard Saver, Club Lloyds Saver, Online Saver, Offset Saver, Child Saver, Young Saver, Flexible Savings and Smart Start Savings Account. Not all of these accounts are available to new customers, but if you already have one you will be able to set Save the Change up on it.
Before July 2018, some Lloyds Bank customers chose to save their change to accounts held by others, like family or friends. This isn't available to new Save the Change customers. If you already pay your change to someone else, this can continue but you won't be able to change the person. You can only change to one of your own Lloyds Bank savings accounts.

## Lloyds Bank Save the Change special conditions

Our agreement with you is made up of:

- the Lloyds Bank personal banking terms and conditions;
- the special conditions that apply to your bank account;
- the special conditions that apply to the savings account you've chosen; and
- these special conditions

If there's a conflict, these special conditions apply.

## How does Save the Change work?

When you pay with your Lloyds Bank debit card, we'll round the amount up to the next whole pound. We'll do this when we take the payment from your account. We'll add the difference ('the change') to the change from other Lloyds Bank debit card purchases we process for you that day. As long as this doesn't take your bank account overdrawn (or more overdrawn) we'll add your total change to your chosen savings account at the start of the next working day.

## What payments can I use Save the Change with?

You can save the change from payments you make with your Lloyds Bank debit card (including Contactless and Mobile payments) except for:

- cash withdrawals, through branches, cash machines, shops and similar outlets;
- any foreign currency you buy;
- any bill payments you make through a machine; or
- any fees you're charged for using a Lloyds Bank ATM


## Good to know

- If you pay for something that's a whole pound amount, we won't round your payment up to the next pound;
- If you pay for something in a foreign currency, we'll only save your change after the amount of your foreign currency transaction has been changed to pounds and any charges applied;
- If your Lloyds Bank debit card transaction is cancelled or reversed (for example you get a refund), or if you tell us you think it was fraudulent, your change will stay in the savings account;
- If you have a joint bank account, we'll save the change from all your joint account holders' Lloyds Bank debit card payments too. This means you mustn't register for Lloyds Bank Save the Change unless all your joint account holders agree. You must all transfer your change to the same savings account;
- If you sign up for Everyday Offers, the cashback you earn will be based on the amount of your debit card purchase or payment without the change you save

# Checking if you might go overdrawn

Before we transfer any change we'll check the credit balance you've got available, less the amount of any card transactions you've made which haven't yet been taken from your account.

## Weekends and bank holidays

Normally:

- any change you save from debit card payments we process on a Friday will be added to the savings account at the start of Monday;
- any change you save from debit card payments we process for Saturday, Sunday and Monday will be added together at the end of Monday and transferred to the savings account as one amount at the start of Tuesday

If the Friday, Monday or Tuesday aren't working days, we'll add your change over the extra days. We'll work out the total amount of your change at the end of the first working day and transfer it to your chosen savings account at the start of the next working day, as long as this doesn't take your bank account overdrawn or more overdrawn.
