# Lloyds Bank Lend a Hand Conditions

Lend a Hand is a savings account for Club Lloyds current account customers who don't need access to their savings for at least 3 years, and want to help someone close to them buy a home. Your savings account will be additional security for a Lend a Hand mortgage to a close family member (the borrower).

The account pays interest at a fixed rate over the 3 year Lend a Hand savings term. Please remember, you won't be able to take your savings out, or close your account, until we release your security for the Lend a Hand mortgage loan.

Lend a Hand savings account is a restricted savings account - this affects how and when we tell you about any changes.

## Having a Lend a Hand savings account, and making deposits

Your account will start as either an Easy Saver or a Club Lloyds Saver.

You must pay 10\% of the agreed purchase price of the property to be covered by the Lend a Hand mortgage (up to $Â£ 50,000$ ) at least 7 working days before the borrower completes their purchase. You can do this using Internet Banking, calling us or coming into one of our branches with a counter.
(Please remember, Saturdays, Sundays and English bank holidays don't count as part of the 7 working days.) The borrower's Lend a Hand mortgage offer will say how much you should pay in. Please tell the borrower's conveyancer when you've done this.

You must also sign a Legal Charge document. The conveyancer will send it to you. It contains important terms, and gives us certain rights over the money in your Lend a Hand savings account if the borrower does not meet their obligations. This is because your savings (except for any interest) are additional security for the mortgage. We recommend you take legal advice before you sign the Legal Charge. If the borrower doesn't do everything required by the mortgage you may not get all your savings back.

Shortly before the purchase completes, we'll add the Easy Saver or Club Lloyds Saver interest to the savings account you chose at account opening. Your account will then change to a Lend a Hand savings account. We'll let you know this has happened. We'll tell you the new interest rate, and the start date for your 3 year term. The same sort code and account number will apply.

Once your account changes to a Lend a Hand savings account, you won't be able to add any more to it or take your savings out.

## Interest

We pay fixed interest - this means your interest rate won't change during the 3 year Lend a Hand fixed term.

We pay interest each year, on the anniversary of your account changing to a Lend a Hand savings account.

You can choose either to have your interest added to your Lend a Hand savings account, or transferred to the account you chose when you first opened your account as Easy Saver or Club Lloyds Saver.

## Account information

Normally we provide a statement each year, and when your account matures.

You can also check your account using Internet Banking or our Mobile Banking app.

## Maturity

Your account will change to Standard Saver, usually the working day after it matures at the end of your 3 year fixed term. The same sort code and account number will continue, and the Standard Saver interest rate and account conditions will apply to your savings.

If the borrower isn't in arrears on the Lend a Hand mortgage, we'll release the security over your savings. The Legal Charge will no longer apply, and you can take your money out of the Standard Saver account straightaway.

If the borrower is in arrears, we won't release the security over your savings. Our legal charge from the Security Document will continue to apply until the borrower has cleared all arrears, and the Lend a Hand mortgage is up to date. You can't take your money out of the Standard Saver account until we release the Legal Charge. The Standard Saver interest rate will apply to your savings.

We'll send you full details of Standard Saver before the change, and also let you know if you can take your savings out straightaway. If you keep your savings in Standard Saver after we release the Legal Charge, we'll take you as having agreed to the new account conditions.

## The Legal Charge

We'll release our security over your savings at the first of:

- the end of your Lend a Hand savings account term, if the borrower isn't in arrears; or
- after the borrower has repaid all the money owed under the Lend a Hand mortgage loan. If this happens before the end of your 3 year Lend a Hand savings account term, your savings account will continue until it matures

If the borrower misses 2 monthly payments while you have your account we can require you to pay us what they owe. We won't ask you to pay any more than you put into your Lend a Hand savings account. We'll contact you before we take anything from your account.

If the mortgaged property is repossessed while the Legal Charge is in place, and the amount from the property sale isn't enough to repay the Lend a Hand mortgage loan, we can ask you to pay us what the borrower owes. We won't ask you to pay any more than you put into your Lend a Hand savings account. We'll get in touch with you before we take anything from your account.

## Bear in mind

You can only use Lend a Hand savings to help someone in your close family buy a home with a Lend a Hand mortgage. To be 'close family' of the borrower, you must be their:

- parent, step parent, adoptive parent or parent-in-law;
- brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister, step-brother, step-sister, brother-in-law or sister-in-law;
- child, step-child or adopted child;
- grandparent or step-grandparent; or
- aunt or uncle
( You can only have a Lend a Hand savings account if you live in England or Wales.
( You can only have a joint Lend a Hand savings account if you both live at the same address, or have the same surname.
( You can't be a named applicant on the Lend a Hand Mortgage.
( You can't open a Lend a Hand savings account if you're acting for someone under a Power of Attorney.
( You can't add a new joint account holder during the 3 year term. You can tell us you no longer want to be a joint customer on your Lend a Hand savings account, but your name will stay as security on the Legal Charge, and you will not be able to take out any money.

The right to cancel doesn't apply to Lend a Hand.
