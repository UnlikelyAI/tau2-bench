## Lloyds Bank Standard Saver

## Lloyds Bank Standard Saver account conditions

Standard Saver is an instant access savings account for people wanting to save $Â£ 1+$. It pays interest at a variable rate. It's a payment account - this affects how and when we tell you about any changes, for example to your interest rate.

## Deposits and withdrawals

You can pay in:

- by transfer from another account, either as a one off or to save regularly; or
- through one of our branches

You can take your money out straightaway:

- by transfer to another Lloyds Bank savings or current account in your name; or
- through one of our branches

You can use Internet Banking, our Mobile Banking app, call us or come into a branch. (Use one of our branches with a counter if you don't have a Cashpoint ${ }^{\circledR}$ card.)
Ask us if you'd like a Cashpoint card to use with your account.

## Interest

We pay variable rate interest - this means your interest rate may change while you have the account.
We may have different interest rates, depending how much you save.
If your account started as a Standard Saver, you can choose to have your interest either once a year or monthly. We pay annual interest on the anniversary of account opening, and monthly interest on the same date each month as you opened your account. Many Standard Saver customers started saving in other accounts that have changed to Standard Saver. This affects when and how often we pay interest. See the Bear in mind section below.
If the day we're due to pay your interest isn't a working day, we'll pay it on the next working day. We'll also include interest for the days in between.
We pay your interest into your account, or you can ask us to pay it into another Lloyds Bank current or savings account in your name. To check the current interest rate for your account balance, see the interest rates leaflet or our website.

## Account information

Normally we provide statements each month. We may not do this if there aren't any payments from your account.
You can choose to have statements less often.
You can also check your account using Internet Banking or our Mobile Banking app.

# Bear in mind

If your Standard Saver is held jointly, you can make a transfer or ask us to pay your interest to a Lloyds Bank account held by either of you as well as one you have together.
You can't make standing orders, direct debits or similar regular payments from your account.
