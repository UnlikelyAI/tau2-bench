# Club Lloyds Advantage Saver

Club Lloyds Advantage Saver is only available to customers with a Club Lloyds current account, Club Lloyds Silver, Club Lloyds Gold, Club Lloyds Platinum, Club Lloyds Premier accounts, Club Lloyds Mayfair High Interest Cheque Account, Club Lloyds Mayfair Current Account, Club Lloyds Private Banking Premier or Club Lloyds Private Banking account.

## Club Lloyds Advantage Saver account conditions

Club Lloyds Advantage Saver is an account for people wanting to save $£ 1+$. It lasts for a year. It's designed for those who don't expect to make more than 3 withdrawals in the account year. You'll have instant access to your savings, but if you make 4 or more withdrawals you will earn interest at a lower rate from the month of your 4th withdrawal to the end of the account year. The account pays interest at a variable rate.

## Deposits and withdrawals

You can pay in:

- by transfer from another account, either as a one off or to save regularly; or
- through one of our branches with a counter.

If you make 4 withdrawals or more, the interest rate you earn from the month of your 4th withdrawal will be lower. (Please see the section on Interest below.)
It's important you keep track of how many withdrawals you make.
You can take your money out straightaway:

- by transfer to another Lloyds Bank savings or current account in your name; or
- through one of our branches with a counter.

You can use Internet Banking, our Mobile Banking app, call us or come into a branch with a counter.

## Interest

We pay variable rate interest - this means your interest rate may change while you have the account.
Your interest rate will also depend on the number of withdrawals you make in a year.

- As long as you don't make any more than 3 withdrawals in the account year, you'll earn the higher Club Lloyds Advantage Saver interest rate.
- If you make 4 or more withdrawals in the account year you'll earn the lower Club Lloyds Advantage Saver interest rate from the month of the 4th withdrawal to the end of the account year.

We may have different interest rates, depending how much you save.
We pay interest monthly, on the same date each month as you opened your account.
If the day we're due to pay your interest isn't a working day, we'll pay it on the next working day. We'll also include interest for the days in between.
We pay your interest into your account, or you can ask us to pay it into another Lloyds Bank current or savings account in your name. To check the current interest rate, based on your account balance and the number of withdrawals you've made, see the interest rates leaflet or our website.



Account information

Normally we provide statements monthly. We may not do this if there aren’t any payments from your account.

You can choose to have statements less often but we’ll always provide at least one in your account year.

You can also check your account using Internet Banking or our Mobile Banking app.

## Maturity

We’ll get in touch before the end of the term, to ask what you’d like to do with your savings.

If we don’t get instructions in time, then on the working day after it matures your account will automatically change to a Standard Saver. After this the Standard Saver interest rate and account conditions will apply to your savings.

You’ll have instant access and we’ll send you full details before the change. If you keep your savings in Standard Saver, we’ll take you as having agreed to the new account conditions.

## Bear in mind

To keep track of your withdrawals and interest rate:

- the account year starts on the date you opened your account or changed it to a Club Lloyds Advantage Saver and ends on the anniversary of account opening, or if that is a non-working day on the next working day. You’ll have an unlimited number of withdrawals after your account changes following maturity; and
- we work out the interest rate for any month on the same date in the month as you opened your account. For example, if you opened your account on 15 January and made your 4th withdrawal on 29 September, you’ll get the lower rat from 16 September to the end of your account year.

If your Club Lloyds Advantage Saver is held jointly, you can make a transfer or ask us to pay your interest to a Lloyds Bank account held by either of you as well as one you have together.

If your account changes to Standard Saver, your account number and sort code will stay the same.

You can’t make standing orders, direct debits or similar regular payments from your account.

You can only have five Club Lloyds Advantage Saver accounts, either just in your name or jointly.

Club Lloyds Advantage Saver is a restricted savings account – this affects how and when we tell you about changes we make to your savings account. We explain more about this in the Lloyds Bank personal banking terms and conditions, which also apply to your account.
