# Guide to Changes Changes to our Bank Accounts and Savings Accounts Terms \& Conditions

# Summary of changes

From 2 June 2025, we're making some changes to our banking and savings terms and conditions. We're also making some updates to the wording for accuracy, and to make it clearer and easier to understand.
Copies of the new terms and conditions will be available from 2 June 2025 at: lloydsbank.com Or ask us for a copy. It's important to understand what the changes mean for you - so please take the time to read them.

## (E) Changes to our banking services

The services we offer in branches and through telephone banking are changing. We've updated how you can pay in and take out money and manage your account. This includes using self-service cash machines, telephone banking, the Mobile Banking app and online banking.
When we use 'branch' in our conditions, we mean Lloyds Bank, Halifax or Bank of Scotland branches.

## Paying in and taking money out of your account

- From 2 June 2025 the Post Office ${ }^{\circledR}$ will stop accepting personalised paying in slips, so you'll only be able to pay cash into an account this way if you have a debit card and PIN.
- From 31 December 2025 you'll also no longer be able to pay cheques into your account at the Post Office.
You'll continue to have ways to pay cash in or take cash out of your account. We've simplified how we describe these to make it clearer:
- You can pay cash into your account at a Post Office, a Banking Hub or a cash machine that accepts cash payments. The cash will be added to your account immediately and you can use it straightaway.
- The Post Office, Banking Hubs and some cash machines do not accept cash payments with savings cards.
- You can take out cash at cash machines with a debit card or savings card. If you have a debit card, you can also take out cash at Post Offices and Banking Hubs.
There's information about the different ways you can pay money in on our website at:
lloydsbank.com/servicequality


## Day-to-day banking

More of our day-to-day banking is possible using online banking and the Mobile Banking app.
If there's a self-serve option, some branch and telephone banking services may not be available. For example, we could ask you to:

- Use the Mobile Banking app to update your personal details.
- Use a self-service machine to pay in cash or cheques instead of using the in-branch counter.
A member of our team will be there to support you if you need them. The services that will be available in branches may vary and may be different by branch.


## Telephone banking

Our telephone banking opening hours have changed. You can find details about how and when to contact us on our website, at: lloydsbank.com/servicequality

# Protecting you from fraud

## Updated APP Scam Refund rules from 7 October 2024

We've updated our conditions to include the new rules introduced by the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR). The rules apply if you experience an Authorised Push Payment (APP) scam. This is if you're tricked into making a payment from your account to a fraudster. The rules don't apply to payments you've made using debit or credit cards, cheques or cash.
If you believe you've sent one or more payments to a fraudster's bank account by either:

1. Faster Payment: Sending money electronically in near-real time.
2. CHAPS: Same day bank transfer, usually for large amounts.
Then:

## - Make a claim

- You must tell us as soon as possible.
- You must make your claim within 13 months of the payment. Or the last payment if you made more than one.
- You can make a claim for any amount, but only the first $£ 85,000$ is covered by the PSR scheme rules. In some cases, we may decide to refund more.


## - We'll investigate

- Where a refund is due to you, we'll make the payment within five working days. But it could take up to 35 days if we need more time.
- We'll apply a $£ 100$ excess from the total refund. This is a fixed amount for each claim you make. For example, if your claim is for $£ 1,000$, your refund will be $£ 900$. If something stops you from being able to protect yourself while making a payment, we won't apply the excess.
- We won't refund your money if you give us false details. Or pretend to be someone else.


## - Report to the police

- If in England, Wales or Northern Ireland you should always report fraud to Action Fraud and the police.
- If in Scotland, you should always report fraud to Police Scotland.

## Why we may delay a payment

To reflect changes in the law, we're updating when and why we might need to delay a faster payment or CHAPS payment you've made. This could be for up to four days in cases where we suspect fraud, so we can make further checks. We'll let you know before we do this and why - unless a legal or security reason means we can't. In that case, we'll let you know as soon as possible afterwards.

## Moving you to paper-free

We're trying to reduce how much paper we use, and we hope you'll help us:

- If you're registered for online banking or use the Mobile Banking app, we may email you about moving your accounts to paper-free, if they aren't already.
- To help us do this please make sure your contact details, including your email address, are up to date. You can do this by logging in to online banking and checking your profile.
- When your accounts go paper-free, we'll send your statements and most of your letters to your online banking digital inbox instead of by post.
- Getting communications from us this way is safe and secure. Only you can log in to online banking or the Mobile Banking app to view, download and print them.
- We'll explain more in our email, and you'll have the option to opt out.
- If you're not registered for online banking and would like to be, you can do this at: lloydsbank.com/online-banking


## Click to Pay

Click to Pay is a simplified checkout that allows you to buy things online securely, without having to enter your debit card details.

- We may enable your card for Click to Pay. We'll get in touch with you first, when you'll have the option to opt out. Once your card is enabled, you can opt out at any time.
- If you've already registered your card, you don't need to do anything. You can carry on using Click to Pay.
There's more information in our terms and conditions. Or search 'Click to Pay' on our website.


## Interest payments on Student Accounts

From 2 June 2025, we'll no longer pay credit interest on any balances on all Student Accounts. This means you won't earn interest on any money you have in your Student Account.

## We're changing the name from 'Internet Banking' to 'Online Banking'

The service itself isn't changing - just the name. You might still see "Internet Banking" here and there while we make the switch.

## Changes to Smart Start accounts

- To open an account, the parent or guardian needs to have any current account with us. They'll no longer need to have a Club Lloyds account.
- When the child is approaching 18 years old:
- We'll ask to see appropriate identification to move them to an adult account.
- If this isn't possible, we'll close the account when the child turns 18.


## Foreign currencies

In future, we'll make more foreign currencies available for when you're sending money outside the UK. These will be called "non-standard" foreign currencies.

## Banker's drafts

We no longer issue banker's drafts.

## Our rights and obligations

We've made the conditions clearer about our rights and obligations under the agreement and that we can transfer our rights to someone else.
If we do this, your rights under the agreement will stay the same.

## Statement fees

We no longer charge a $£ 5$ fee if you ask for a copy of your statement.

## CHAPS transaction fees

We've lowered the fee we charge for making each CHAPS transaction from $£ 30$ to $£ 25$.

## Joint account changes

If more than one person holds an account, it's called a joint account.
We've updated our conditions to reflect that:

- You can't open a new joint account for more than two people.
- You won't be able to add another person to an existing joint account.


## Interest payments on Under 19s accounts

We've corrected our conditions:

- We'll pay credit interest on Under 19s accounts for balances from $£ 0.01$ instead of $£ 1$.

# Overdrafts

## Updates to overdraft conditions

We're including more detail in our conditions to:

- Explain what an arranged or unarranged overdraft is.
- Give you more information about how an overdraft works. For example, whether using it may affect your credit score. And more detail about bringing an overdraft to an end.


## Savings

## If we lower your interest rate

We've removed that we'll contact you at least 14 days before we lower your interest rate.

- We'll continue to let you know, by post or electronically, before we lower your interest rate.
- This could be less than 14 days before the change.

We won't contact you if you have less than $£ 100$ in your account.

## Instant access savings accounts

- We've made it clearer when we'll pay monthly or annual interest into instant access savings accounts. And from 2 June 2025, we'll change some interest payment dates - check the updated terms and conditions to see yours.
- If you have an instant access savings account, you can withdraw money directly from the account to any Lloyds Bank account or an account with another financial provider.


## Information about rate changes

We'll no longer display information about changes to our rates in our branches. You'll still be able to see it on our website. We may also get in touch with you in writing, by post or electronically.

Withdrawing cash: If you take money in pounds from your account using any Lloyds cash machines in the UK, we won't charge you for the withdrawal. However, if you use a cash machine that isn't a Lloyds cash machine, you may be charged by the machine owner. If so, the machine will show you the amount and tell you it will be taken from your account when you withdraw the cash.

Overdrafts are subject to application and approval. We may ask you to repay this at any time.
