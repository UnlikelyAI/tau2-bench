## Why use a savings calculator?

You could be planning a large expense, or just want the peace of mind that you've got a financial safety net in place. Either way, a savings account calculator can help you quickly work out:

- How much you'll need to put aside each month to meet your goal.
- How long it could take to save the desired amount. 

You could also be considering whether to choose between savings or credit. If you can afford to wait, it often pays off to take your time and save up for the things you want. While credit is convenient, it could be more expensive, especially when you account for interest, fees and other charges.
