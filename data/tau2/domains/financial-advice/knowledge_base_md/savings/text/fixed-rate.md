# Fixed Rate Savings Accounts | Lloyds Bank

## What is a fixed-rate savings account?

These accounts offer you a fixed rate of interest over a set period - known as a term - spanning anything from one to three years.

Your interest returns could be higher with a fixed rate account, compared to an instant access account. The main reason for that is they're much less flexible. 

Although you may be able to withdraw money, charges usually apply - cutting the value of any interest you've earned. But if you can afford to lock your money in, a fixed savings account can be an effective way to put your money to work.

## FAQs

### Are fixed rate savings a good idea?

A fixed-rate savings account can be a good idea if you have a lump sum of money to save that you can afford to keep locked away for a fixed term. This gives you an interest rate that stays the same during the account’s term.

---

### Can I withdraw money from a fixed-rate account before maturity?

Whether you can withdraw money from a fixed-rate savings account, really depends on the terms that apply. Many accounts don’t allow you to withdraw funds before the date of maturity. Others may allow you to withdraw, but charges usually apply – cutting the value of any interest you’ve earned. In some cases, you may also have to close your account.
**Check the terms and conditions before opening a savings account with a fixed rate and term.**

---

### What happens when my fixed rate ends?

It depends on what type of fixed-rate savings account you have. Fixed-rate cash ISAs with Lloyds change to Instant Cash ISAs after the term ends. Fixed Bonds and the Lend a Hand Fixed Savings Account change to Standard Saver accounts at the end of their terms.
