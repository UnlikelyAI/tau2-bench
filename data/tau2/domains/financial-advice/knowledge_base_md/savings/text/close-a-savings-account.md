# Close a Savings Account | Lloyds Bank

## Close a Savings Account Online

You can close your account using online banking if:

- The balance is £5 or less
- You have another account with Lloyds Bank to transfer the closing balance to
- It has a variable interest rate.

To close a **Help to Buy: ISA**, you need:

- A balance of £15,000 or less
- A Lloyds current account to transfer funds to.

An ISA closure statement will be emailed to you once closed.

> **Note:** Not all accounts can be closed online.

## Accounts That Can't Be Closed Online

You may not be able to close your account online for many reasons, such as periods of inactivity or restrictions on your account.

If there are **early closure charges** (usually apply to fixed rate and monthly saver accounts), you can't close it online. You will need to visit a branch so we can discuss the charge with you first.

If you can't go to a branch, the account can be closed with a written request. The written request must include:

- What you are wanting to do
- The sort code and account number of the account you want to close
- Clear instructions if you want us to transfer the money to another internal account, an external account, or payment by cheque.

The written request must be signed by the account holder.

If the account has over £10,000, you must send **certified copies of your photographic identification**. You'll need to speak to your solicitor who can certify your documents.

- Allow a minimum of five working days for us to transfer the money into the other account from the date you post the letter.
- If requesting a cheque, allow ten working days.

> We can’t action written requests and send money to a third-party account if we don’t hold your signature on file.

**Postal address:**
Lloyds Bank PLC, Box 1, BX1 1LT

To speak to someone, call us or visit your nearest branch.

## Joint Accounts

You can close a joint account online unless you have previously requested that both parties named on the account sign their names to authorise any changes.

---

## Additional Information

- **Account balance more than £5:** Transfer money out so the balance is £5 or less.
- **Not received the closing balance?** Call us or visit your nearest branch.

### Receiving Outstanding Interest

If you close your savings account online we’ll work out any remaining interest on the account and transfer it along with the remaining balance to an account chosen by you within 24 hours. A statement showing your closing balance will be shown on screen once your account is closed. This screen can be printed or saved.

### Can’t Open a New Account Online

There are limits on how many of the same savings account you can have (e.g., up to 5 Club Lloyds Saver accounts, but only 1 Club Lloyds Monthly Saver every 12 months). You may have to wait until you can open another if you’ve reached the maximum number.

Your account won’t be fully closed until the day after your request. You may not be able to open more savings accounts until the account is fully closed.

### Help to Buy: ISA with More Than £15,000 or No Lloyds Current Account

Visit your nearest branch to complete this closure. If you move your balance to a non-ISA account before closure, the money will lose its tax-free status.
