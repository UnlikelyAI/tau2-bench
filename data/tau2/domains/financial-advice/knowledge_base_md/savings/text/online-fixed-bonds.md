### How do I open and manage my account?

This account can be opened and managed:
- online
- branch
- phone.

You can open this account if you:
- are 16 or over
- are a UK resident
- have £2,000 or more to save.

You need to pay at least **£2,000** into the account **within 10 days** of opening it. There is no limit to the number of payments you can make within these 10 days. After the 10 days are up, you can’t make any further payments into the account. The maximum you can pay into the account is **£10,000,000**.

Online applications must be made in your sole name.

You can make the account joint by going into the branch after you’ve opened it.

You can only have one Online Fixed Bond – 1 Year account. You can also have up to 5 Online Fixed Bond – 2 Year accounts.

### Can I withdraw money?

You can’t make withdrawals from this account, but you can close the account early by visiting one of our branches with a counter. Bear in mind that if you close the account early:
- For the one year term account you’ll be charged the equivalent of **90 days’ gross interest**.
- For the two year term account you’ll be charged the equivalent of **180 days’ gross interest**.

This means you may get back less than you put in.

At the end of the 1 or 2 year term, your account will change to a **Standard Saver**. Before this happens, we'll contact you to explain your options and next steps.

### Additional information

#### Savings terms explained

- **Gross rate** means we won’t deduct tax from the interest we pay on money in your account. It’s your responsibility to pay any tax you may owe to HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC).
- **AER** stands for Annual Equivalent Rate. Whenever you see an advert for a savings account which shows an interest rate, you will see the AER. This means you can use the AER to compare accounts. It shows what the interest rate would be if your interest was paid and compounded once each year.
