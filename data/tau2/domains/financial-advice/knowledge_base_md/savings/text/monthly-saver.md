## Summary Box for the Monthly Saver

### What is the interest rate?

- **5.25% gross/AER fixed** on balances of £1 or more for 12 months.
- Your interest is paid **12 months after you open the account**.

### Can Lloyds Bank change the interest rate?

- **No.** This account has a fixed rate of interest. The rate won't change during the term.

### What might the future balance be?

- If you deposit **£250.00 every month for 12 months**, you'll have a balance of **£3,078.75** after interest is paid.
  - This assumes:
    - You deposit £250.00 in the middle of each month.
    - You don't withdraw any money or interest.

*Interest accumulates daily. Your balance is lower at the start of the term and grows after each monthly deposit. This means your daily interest calculation will also slowly increase. Interest is paid to your account at the end of the term.*

### How do I open and manage my account?

**Opening this account**
- You can open and manage this account:
  - Online
  - On our app

- You can top up your savings by bank transfer. This **cannot exceed the £250 monthly limit**.

**When you can open another Monthly Saver**
- You can only open **one Monthly Saver every 12 months**.
- If you close the account before the end of the term, you can’t open another one until after the term ends.
- If you keep your account open, after 12 months you’ll receive your interest. The account will then change to a **Standard Saver**. You can then open a new Monthly Saver and save for another 12 months.
- You'll need to set up a new standing order to this Monthly Saver account. This needs to be between £25 and £250 each month. Remember to cancel your old standing order unless you want to keep saving into the Standard Saver.

### Additional Information
