# Fixed Rate Maturity – Lloyds Bank

## Maturity Options

You can give your maturity instructions up to 14 days before your account matures.
If you have a joint account, you’ll need to call us or visit a branch.

**If you've got a Fixed Cash ISA and don’t give us an instruction, your account will automatically change to an Instant Cash ISA.**
**If you've got a Fixed Saver and don’t give us an instruction, your account will automatically change to a Standard Saver.**

### The Four Maturity Options
When your fixed rate account matures, you can:

1. **Reinvest full balance.**
2. **Reinvest balance and add funds.**
3. **Partial withdrawal and reinvest balance.**
4. **Withdraw full balance and close account.**

## How to provide instructions

- **Online:** Log in and select "Amend your maturity instruction." Confirm your selection to complete the process.
- **By Phone or Branch:** If not registered for Internet Banking or you have a joint account, you can call or visit a branch.

## Key Information

- If your account matures on a Friday, weekend, or bank holiday, requested changes will show in online banking the next working day.

## Reinvesting into a Fixed Cash ISA

### Benefits

- All interest is paid tax-free.
- You can pay in and out as many times as you like in the same tax year. It won’t count towards your ISA allowance.
- You have 14 days from the date the ISA changes to cancel the account with no charge (by closing or transferring to another ISA product). Any credit balance will be paid back to you, with interest for the time your money was with us.

### Interest Payments

You can select where your interest is paid:
- To your ISA
- To another account with us
- To another bank or building society

If interest is paid to a different account that is **not** tax-free, that interest may be taxed.

**At the end of the fixed term, unless we receive instructions from you, your account will automatically change to an Instant Cash ISA.**

## If Your Fixed Cash ISA Has Already Matured

- If your Fixed Cash ISA matured and you didn't give instructions, it will have changed into an easy access cash ISA.
- You may leave your money in the Instant Cash ISA or renew into a different ISA account.
