# Lloyds Bank Instant Access Savings Accounts

Instant-access (or easy access) savings accounts—also known as flexible savings accounts—allow you to earn variable interest on your savings, without locking your money away for a fixed term. You can withdraw money when needed. For this flexibility, interest rates may be lower compared to fixed-rate accounts, and each withdrawal may affect your interest rate.

We offer a range of flexible accounts, with minimum deposits starting from as little as £1. You can have instant access to your money when you need it.
