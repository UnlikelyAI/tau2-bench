# Lloyds Bank Joint Savings Account

## Overview

Open an account in two peoples' names or add another person to your existing account.

---

## Features and Benefits

- With two people sharing one account, you can reach your shared savings goals faster.
- Both account holders can manage the account in branch, through Internet Banking or over the phone.
- If the account comes with a Cashpoint® card, you can have one for each of you.
- You can grow your savings even faster by registering for Save the Change™.
- Both account holders can set up standing orders.

---

## Things to Keep in Mind

- You might be unable to open a joint account for all savings accounts, such as cash ISAs.
- Either account holder is able to close the account in a branch. However, if Lloyds Bank becomes aware of a dispute between you, they may prevent either of you giving instructions or using the account individually until it’s resolved.

---

## How to Open a Joint Savings Account

- Online applications must be initially opened in a sole name. Once opened, your account can be made joint in branch or over the phone.

### Requirements

- The person you add to your existing savings account must be over 16 and have a Lloyds Bank current account; unless you have an Online Step Bond or Easy Saver, then they don’t need to have a Lloyds Bank current account.
