> The interest rate is variable. The rate applies to the full balance. Your interest frequency will stay the same.

### Can Lloyds Bank change the interest rate?

**Yes.** As this account pays a variable rate of interest it can change over time. We’ll always let you know of any planned changes to the rate.
Terms and conditions explain when and how we do this. For example, we might review the interest rate if the Bank of England base rate changes.

### What might the future balance be?

For example:
- If you deposit **£1,000.00** when you open the account, the balance after **12 months** will be **£1,011.00**.
- If you deposit **£25,000.00**, the balance after **12 months** will be **£25,300.00**.
- If you deposit **£100,000.00**, the balance after **12 months** will be **£101,350.00**.

This assumes:
- The interest rate stays the same for 12 months.
- You make your deposit on the day you open the account and you don't add more money after that.
- You do not withdraw any money or interest.
