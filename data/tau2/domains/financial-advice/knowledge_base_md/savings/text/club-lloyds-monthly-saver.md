Take advantage of this exclusive savings rate with our Club Lloyds current account.

## Who this account is for

Ideal if you want to save regularly for 12 months, get a fixed rate of interest, and have instant access to your money.

- You need to be 18 or over and a UK resident.

## The Benefits

- **Earn 6.25% AER/gross fixed interest.** This is paid after 12 months.

## How it works

- You can only have one Club Lloyds Monthly Saver in your sole name or held jointly.

## Summary Box for Club Lloyds Monthly Saver

### What is the interest rate?

- **Earn 6.25% gross/AER fixed** on balances of £1 or more for 12 months.
- Your interest is paid 12 months after you open the account.

### Can Lloyds change the interest rate?

- **No.** This account has a fixed rate of interest so the rate won't change during the term.

### What might the future balance be?

- For example, if you deposit **£400.00 every month for 12 months** you'll have a balance of **£4950.00 after interest is paid.**
    - This assumes you deposit £400.00 in the middle of each month and you don’t withdraw any money or interest.
    - Interest is calculated each day. As your balance is lower at the start of the term and grows after each monthly deposit, your daily interest calculation also slowly increases. At the end of the term your interest deposits into your savings account.
