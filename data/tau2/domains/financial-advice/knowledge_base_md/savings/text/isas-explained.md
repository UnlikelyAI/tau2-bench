# What is an ISA?

An Individual Savings Account (ISA) helps you to save and invest tax efficiently.

There are four different kinds of ISA:
- Cash ISA
- Stocks and Shares ISA
- Lifetime ISA
- Innovative Finance ISA

You can subscribe to the four types of ISA in lots of combinations. But you can’t exceed the overall annual ISA allowance of **£20,000**.

To apply for a cash ISA, you must be at least 18 and a UK resident for tax purposes.

---

## The ISA Allowance

- The government sets a limit each tax year (April 6th to April 5th the next year) on the amount you can save in an ISA.
- The limit is **£20,000** for the current year.
- Your total subscriptions across all types of ISAs can't be more than **£20,000 per tax year**.
- You can *only* pay into one cash ISA with Lloyds Bank in any tax year up to the annual limit. This includes existing Help to Buy: ISA contributions of up to £200 per month.
- **Total subscriptions per tax year across all four ISA types can’t be over £20,000.**
  - Stocks and shares ISA up to £20,000
  - Innovative finance ISA up to £20,000
  - Lifetime ISA up to £4,000
- You can transfer a cash ISA or stocks and shares ISA to Lloyds Bank.
  - Transferring current year subscriptions from one ISA to another still counts towards your annual subscription limit.
  - If you transfer subscriptions from the last tax year, they do *not* affect your current year subscription limit.
- You can *replace withdrawals* into the same Flexible ISA within the same tax year without affecting your ISA allowance. This only applies to Lloyds Bank easy access cash ISA.

## Cash ISAs

A cash ISA is a savings account where you don't pay UK tax on the interest you earn, which helps your money to grow faster.

- You can either:
  - Have easy access to your money and withdraw free of charge (variable rate).
  - Or lock your money away for a higher fixed interest rate (early withdrawal charges may apply).

**Please remember:**
- You can only subscribe to one cash ISA with Lloyds Bank in a tax year. You can pay into any other ISA for which you qualify for each tax year.
- If you close a fixed ISA before the term ends, you could get back less than you paid in.
- You can make unlimited withdrawals from your Help to Buy: ISA but you can't claim the Government bonus on any money you withdraw.

---

## Stocks and Shares ISAs

A stocks and shares ISA allows you to hold a range of investments. The income and profits from investments have protection from UK Income and Capital Gains tax.

- You can create a portfolio within a Share Dealing ISA from a wide range of investment options.
- New investors can select from three ready-made investment options with the investment ISA.

**Please remember:**
- You can only invest using one of these two options in a tax year. This includes Stocks and Shares ISAs held outside of Lloyds Bank.
- The value of investments and the income from them can go up and down. You may get back less than you invested. Charges apply.
- Tax treatment depends on your individual circumstances and may change. Please seek independent advice if you're unsure about investing. There will normally be a charge for that advice.

## Help to Buy: ISA

- You are **no longer able to apply** for a Help to Buy ISA.
- You can transfer an existing Help to Buy ISA from another provider to Lloyds Bank.
- If you already have one, you can still save up to £200 a month by standing order. You can also claim the government bonus, depending on your eligibility. You may transfer it to another provider.

**If your house sale falls through:**
- Help to Buy: ISA will be set up again with the savings you had at point of bonus claim.
- Visit your local branch to start the process.
- Bonus returns to the scheme administrator, but you can claim again when you find another home.
- Visit the branch within 12 months of closing your Help to Buy: ISA.

---

## How do ISAs save you tax?

- The interest on cash ISAs is free from UK Income Tax.
- You don’t pay UK Income Tax or UK Capital Gains Tax on potential earnings from:
  - Stocks and shares ISA
  - Innovative finance ISA
  - Lifetime ISA

---

## Who can have an ISA?

- You must be 18 or older and a UK resident for tax purposes. This applies to a cash ISA, stocks and shares ISA, innovative finance ISA, or Lifetime ISA.
- Crown employees living abroad (e.g., diplomats, armed forces) can also apply.

---

## Flexible Cash ISA Withdrawals

- In a flexible cash ISA, you must replace withdrawals within the same tax year and into the same account for them not to count again towards your allowance.
- Money added to a stocks and shares ISA will reduce your remaining ISA allowance, even if you withdrew the same amount earlier that tax year.

---

## Differences Between ISA types

- **Cash ISAs:** Save without paying any UK Income Tax on interest. As safe as any other savings account.
- **Stocks and Shares ISAs:** Suitable for investing five years or more. Hold investments without UK Capital Gains Tax on profits. Income from investments is free from UK Income Tax. Investment values may go up or down; you may get back less than you invested.

---

## ISA Minimum Deposit Requirements

- Some cash ISAs can be opened from as little as **£1**.
- Stocks and shares ISAs may require a higher opening amount depending on account type.

---

## Variable vs Fixed Rate ISAs

- **Variable rate ISA:** Interest rate can go up or down at any time.
- **Fixed rate cash ISA:** Usually offers higher rates that don’t change during the term, but charges apply if you withdraw money during the term.

---

## Access to Money

- **Variable rate cash ISAs:** Offer instant access to your money.
- **Fixed rate ISAs:** Could have higher rates, if you lock money away for two or more years (withdrawal charges may apply).
- **Stocks and shares ISAs:** Allow access to your money at any time, but you should invest for at least five years.

---

## ISA Transfers

- Lloyds Bank does *not* charge transfer fees to move your cash ISA or stock from your Share Dealing ISA to another provider, but will charge outstanding administration fees when transferring a Share Dealing ISA. Dealing charges may apply.
- Your current provider may charge to transfer to a Lloyds Bank ISA.
- Your new ISA provider typically arranges the transfer.

---

## Tax Year Dates

- The tax year runs from **April 6 in one year to April 5 in the following year**.

---

## Protecting Your Money

- The Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) protects up to **£85,000** of the eligible money you hold with Lloyds Bank.

---

## Personal Savings Allowance

- Based on your tax band, you can earn up to **£1,000** in tax-free interest annually with your personal savings allowance (PSA).
