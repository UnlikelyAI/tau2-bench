# What does per annum mean? (Lloyds)

## A quick summary

**Per annum** means each year. It's often used to describe the intervals between interest payments.

Other ways to say this might be **annually**, **yearly**, or **over 12 months**.

## When might per annum apply?

Per annum describes things like the: 
- annual cost of renting a property
- amount you earn from a salary or wages each year
- rate of interest you’ll pay each year on a mortgage, credit card or loan
- rate of interest you’ll receive each year on a savings balance

## Earning interest on savings

As a very simple example, imagine you have £1,000 in a savings account offering interest at 3% per annum. After one year, you could expect to receive interest of £30.

Interest may be paid to you monthly, annually, or at another time, even though it's calculated per annum.

To work out the monthly amount, for example, simply divide the per annum figure by 12. So, if you earned £30 in interest per annum that would equate to £2.50 per month.

When browsing for savings accounts, look out for the **AER**, or **Annual Equivalent Rate**. This should help you to compare accounts and understand the potential gains more clearly. That’s because AER accounts for the effect of compound interest, where you can earn interest on interest you’ve already earned.

## Paying tax on interest earned

The government set limits on what you can earn before tax is payable. These limits and rules change over time. Taxable income could include interest from savings accounts, or dividends from investments. Interest earned through an **ISA** is usually tax-free.
