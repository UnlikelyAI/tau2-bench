# Emergency Fund Calculator | Savings | Lloyds Bank

## How much should I have in my emergency fund?

An emergency fund is money that you’ve saved for unexpected bills and costs.

How much you put aside will depend on your circumstances. The recommendation is to have **three months' worth of essential outgoings in your account to fall back on**. This will give you a financial buffer if you need it.

Use our calculator to find out how much you should save in your emergency fund.

**My essential outgoings each month are:**
