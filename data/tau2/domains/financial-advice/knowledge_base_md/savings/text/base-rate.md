## Understanding the Base Rate

How the base rate affects your savings can seem complex. We're here to help break down the facts.

### The Recent Announcement

On 6 February 2025 the Bank of England announced a decrease in the Bank of England base rate from 4.75% to 4.50%.

## What is the Base Rate?

The base rate, or Bank Rate, impacts interest rates from banks and other financial institutions. The Bank of England sets it, regularly reviews it, and can increase or decrease it at any time.

## How Can a Base Rate Change Affect Your Account?

We consider the base rate among other factors when we decide on the interest rates for our savings accounts.

Whether a base rate change affects your interest rate depends on if you have a fixed or variable account. If you’re unsure what type of account you have, you can check this in the terms and conditions.

### If the Bank of England base rate falls to 0% or below

If the Bank of England announces a rate of 0% or below, we’ll keep our rates under review.

- **Accounts with a fixed rate**
  Your account won't be affected.
- **Accounts with a variable rate**
  Your interest rate could change.
  Whenever the base rate changes, we review the interest rates of our variable accounts and could decide to change them. If we decide to lower your rate, we’ll write to you to let you know. We won’t write to you if we increase your rate.
