## Details

### Overdrafts

Before we transfer any change we'll check the credit balance you've got available, less the amount of any card transactions you've made which haven't yet been taken from your account. As long as this doesn't take your bank account overdrawn (or more overdrawn) we'll add your total change to your chosen savings account at the start of the next working day.

### Joint Accounts

If you have a joint bank account, we'll save the change from all your joint account holders' Lloyds Bank debit card payments too. This means you mustn't register for Lloyds Bank Save the Change unless all your joint account holders agree. You must all transfer your change to the same savings account.

### Switching off Save the Change

You can use Internet Banking to cancel Save the Change or alter the savings account you transfer your change to.
