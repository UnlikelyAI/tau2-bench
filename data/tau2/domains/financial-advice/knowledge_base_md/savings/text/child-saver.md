## Summary box for the Child Saver

### What is the interest rate?

- **2.85% AER/2.81% gross variable** on balances of £1 to £5,000.
- **1.10% AER/1.09% gross variable** on any excess over £5,000.
- Interest is paid monthly.

### Can Lloyds change the interest rate?

- Yes. As this account pays a variable rate of interest it can change over time. Lloyds will always let you know of any planned changes to the rate. See [terms and conditions (PDF, 52KB)] for details.

### What might the future balance be?

- If you deposit **£1,000.00** when you open the account, the balance after **12 months** will be **£1,028.46**.
- If you deposit **£6,000.00** when you open the account, the balance after **12 months** will be **£6,152.15**.

Assumptions:
- The interest rate stays the same for 12 months.
- You make your deposit on the day you open the account and don’t add more money after that.
- You don’t withdraw any money or interest.

If you have more than £5,000 in your account, you’ll get two different interest rates on your balance. The higher rate applies to everything up to £5,000 and the lower rate to everything over £5,000.

### How do I open and manage my account?

- You can open this account online and in branch.
- To open the account in your local Lloyds branch, you'll need to bring proof of your own identity and the child’s (such as a passport or full birth certificate).
- You can manage the account online, on the Lloyds app, in branch, and by phone.

#### Who can open an account

- To open and manage the account, you must be 18 or over, a UK resident, and have a Lloyds current account.
- The child must be 15 or under.
- If you aren't the parent or legal guardian of the child, you need their permission to open the account.

#### Notification

- Once the account is open, a letter will be sent to the child's address informing the parent or legal guardian of this. If the parent or legal guardian does not want the account open, it will be closed and the money returned.
- The child will be contacted when they’re 16 to tell them Lloyds holds their personal information. The account holder will be contacted before this.

#### Account limits

- You can open up to two Child Saver accounts per child.
- You can open the account with between £1 and £9 million.

### Can I withdraw money?

- Yes. You can make as many withdrawals as you like and there are no charges for doing so.
