### Can Lloyds change the interest rate?

Yes. As this account pays a variable rate of interest it can change over time.
We’ll always let you know of any planned changes to the rate. Our terms and conditions (PDF, 51KB) explain when and how we do this. For example, we might review the interest rate if the Bank of England base rate changes.

We’re making some changes to our conditions on 02 June 2025. For details, please see our guide to changes (PDF, 80KB).

### What might the future balance be?

- If you deposit **£1,000.00** when you open the account, the balance after 12 months will be **£1,011.00**.

### Additional information

#### Savings terms explained

**Gross rate**
This means we won’t take tax from the interest we pay on money in your account. You’ll need to pay any tax you may owe to HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC).

**AER**
This stands for Annual Equivalent Rate. Whenever you see an advert for a savings account, which shows an interest rate, you’ll see the AER. This means you can use the AER to compare accounts. It shows what the interest rate would be if your interest was paid and compounded once each year.
