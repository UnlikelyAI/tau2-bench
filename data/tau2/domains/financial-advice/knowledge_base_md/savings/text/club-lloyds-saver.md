### Additional information

#### Savings terms explained

**AER:**
AER stands for Annual Equivalent Rate. Whenever you see an advert for a savings account that shows an interest rate, you'll see the AER. This means you can use the AER to compare accounts. It shows what the interest rate would be if your interest was paid and compounded once each year.

**Gross rate:**
This means we won’t remove tax from the interest we pay on money in your account. You’ll need to pay any tax you may owe to HM Revenue & Customers (HMRC).

---

## How to Apply

- **In our app:**
  You must be registered for online banking. Once you’re in, select Apply, Savings, then Club Lloyds Saver.

- **Online:**
  Whether you're an existing customer or not, you can apply on our website.

- **Other ways:**
  If you’d prefer to speak to someone, call us or visit your nearest branch.
