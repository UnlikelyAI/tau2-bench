## How do children's savings accounts work?

Children’s savings accounts, also known as junior savings accounts, work in a similar way to adult savings accounts.

1. Apply for the account.
2. Make a deposit.
3. Keep on saving when you can.

Some accounts may be managed by the child themselves, while others could be set up and paid into by a parent or guardian until the child beneficiary reaches a certain age.

## FAQs

### Which savings account is best for a child?

When looking for the best savings account for your child, consider:
- The interest rates available
- The terms and conditions for each account
- Whether the child should have access now, or lock funds away for them until they’re older

### Can grandparents open a savings account for their grandchildren?

Grandparents may be able to set up a savings account for their grandchild, so long as they have parental responsibility. If this is not the case, you may be able to set one up with permission from the child’s legal guardian. Before you begin, check the terms and conditions for the child savings account you’d like to open.

### Can I open a savings account at 16?

Yes. If you’re 16 years old, you can open a Junior Cash ISA with Lloyds. Other accounts can only be opened by an adult aged 18 or over, on behalf of a child. Child Saver is designed for children under 15 years of age. Smart Start is for children aged 11 to 15 years old.

### Are children's savings tax free?

There isn’t usually any tax to pay on children’s saving accounts.

If a child earns more than £100 in interest in a single tax year from money given to them by a parent, that should be declared to HM Revenue and Customs. The parent may need to pay tax on any interest above their Personal Savings Allowance. 

The £100 limit doesn’t apply to money held in a Junior ISA, or gifted by grandparents, friends, or relatives.

### Can I open a savings account for a newborn?

Yes, with Lloyds you can open a savings account for a newborn. Choose either a Child Saver account, designed for children under 15 years old, or a Junior Cash ISA, locking money away until the child turns 18.

## Useful savings terms

- **AER (Annual Equivalent Rate):** Shows how much interest you would earn from your savings over a year, accounting for compound interest.
- **Gross:** The percentage of interest you would earn from your savings before tax.
- **Tax Free:** Interest on child savings account and ISAs is usually exempt from tax.

Adults may be able to earn some interest from their savings each year without paying tax, subject to your personal allowance on earnings, starting rate for savings or personal savings allowance. You also have an annual allowance for ISAs, helping you to save in a tax efficient way.
