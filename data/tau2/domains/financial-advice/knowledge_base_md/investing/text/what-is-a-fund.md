# What is a Fund and How Do They Work?

A **fund** is a collective investment, which is managed by a fund manager. They’ll pool your money with other investors and use it to invest in a range of assets like shares, bonds and more. The fund manager is responsible for the mix of investments, deciding what to buy and sell using the total amount of money.

This allows investors to diversify their investments without needing to buy each one individually. Think of it as a basket holding a variety of fruits – instead of buying apples, oranges and bananas separately, you get a mix, all in one go.

## Types of Funds

There are two main types of funds: **active funds** and **tracker funds**.

### Active Funds

A fund manager will regularly monitor the investment mix and decide which assets to buy and sell to meet the fund objectives. 

### Tracker Funds

The fund manager aims to follow the performance of a specific index by selecting the same investments. This means they’ll simply track that index. They’re also known as passive or index funds. They don't need active management, which usually means lower fees.

## What is an Index?

An **index** is a measurement of the performance of a group of assets.

For example, the FTSE 100 index tracks the performance of the 100 largest companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, while the S&P 500 index tracks the performance of 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States.

## Why Invest in a Fund?

There are several key benefits to investing in a fund:

- **Convenience**
  Funds simplify the investment process, making it easier for you to invest without needing to manage large numbers of individual holdings. The fund manager does all the work – so you don’t have to.

- **Diversification**
  Funds are often made up of a large range of investments. This spreads the risk and makes your investment less prone to sudden market changes.

- **Professional management**
  The fund manager makes investment decisions to deliver the fund objectives.

- **Cost-effective**
  Funds can offer a lower-cost way to invest in a range of assets – especially if selecting a tracker fund.

- **Variety**
  There is a huge variety in the funds you can invest in. This means you can pick to invest in funds that align with your financial goals, level of risk and your personal values and considerations.
