### I have Power of Attorney on a Share Dealing account, why can’t I access the account?

Although you can see the new Share Dealing account in Internet Banking, you will not be able to access this due to restrictions on the account. If you wish to trade or check any account details you should call customer services on **0345 606 0560**.

### Why can’t I see my Share Dealing account in Internet Banking?

This can occur if your full name including titles and any middle names in Internet Banking doesn’t match your full name in Stockbroking. If this is the case you will need to go to the branch to amend your name. Once this is done you can go to Internet Banking help for your records to be merged.
