# Lloyds Bank Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) Quicklist

## Introducing our ETF Quicklist

With thousands of ETFs worldwide, we know getting started can be daunting. That’s why we’ve worked with iShares by BlackRock to produce our ETF Quicklist - a shortlist of ETFs to help you create the basic building blocks of an investment portfolio.

Plus, you can build your portfolio with our regular investment plan and pay no trading fees – that means more of your money is invested for your future.

You can also use the ETF Quicklist to add new investment themes to your portfolio such as technology, healthcare or sustainability, or see what's 'trending now' in the world of ETFs to give you an idea of what you might want to invest in.

If you’re new to investing, you can also use our ETF education academy to get to know the basics.

## ETFs Can Work for All Investors

Lloyds Bank offers a competitive platform for trading ETFs. Our fees are simple and transparent. You pay a six-monthly account fee of £20, trading commission of £11 and benefit from commission-free regular investments.

## What is an ETF?

Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are a simple, more affordable way to invest for your future.

An ETF simply tracks a set of investments (shares, bonds or commodities). They’re grouped together into themes such as countries or sectors. For example, the FTSE 100 ETF tracks the top 100 largest UK companies – when you invest in this ETF, you are gaining exposure to 100 different companies, which could help in spreading your risk and makes choosing an investment easier.

With just a handful of ETFs you can create a low-cost, diversified set of holdings.

## A Simple Way to Start Investing

- ETFs are a quick and easy way to get started on your investment journey as they can give you access to a wide range of investment types with just one fund.
- ETFs are generally lower cost than funds and there’s no stamp duty to pay, which helps you invest more of your hard-earned money.
- Plus, invest regularly from as little as £20 per month and build your portfolio gradually.

## Diversifying Your Existing Portfolio

- ETFs give you access to clear themes such as energy, technology or emerging markets to help you diversify your portfolio and reduce risk.
- You’ll automatically get access to quarterly reports from iShares by BlackRock so you can keep an eye on the investment opportunities.
- Plus, you can see what’s ‘Trending Now’ in the world of ETFs.
- They’re low-cost, attract no stamp duty and are eligible for your ISA.

## Why Set-up a Regular Investment Plan?

- If you set-up a regular investment, you can buy commission-free, meaning more of your money is invested for your future.
- Investing money regularly could help you ride out the ups and downs of the market by drip-feeding money into the market over time. This is called **'pound cost averaging’**.
- Benefit from the power of **compounding** – investing over the longer term means you can get returns off the money you've made in previous years (especially if you re-invest dividends), accelerating your growth.

> **Please remember:** The value of investments and the income from them can fall as well as rise, and you may get back less than you invest. If you’re not sure about investing, seek financial advice. There will normally be a charge for that advice.
