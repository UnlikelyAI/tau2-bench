## The SIPP Start-Up Fund Explained

### What is it?

Our SIPP Start-Up Fund is our standard pension investment option, designed to get you started to meet your retirement goals.

We know not everyone wants to make decisions on which investments or approach to choose, so by teaming up with BlackRock (a global name in investment asset management) we provide access to their LifePath UK Target Date Fund (or TDF).

The investment is designed to simplify investing for individuals looking to save for retirement.

Choose the best target date for when you plan to retire. (Not sure? Just add your age and retirement age into the selector).

We'll match you with an investment to suit your retirement date and provide key information such as past performance, charges and levels of risk in the KIID document.

**The choice to invest is yours.**

---

### How does it work?

The Start-Up Fund is a convenient way to take charge of your retirement goals, with quick access to a diversified range of low-cost funds without the hassle of managing multiple investments.

The fund is managed by the BlackRock retirement solutions team, with over 30 years' experience in global retirement solutions. They align your investments, with the appropriate level of risk as you approach retirement - removing the hassle and the worry of making those adjustments yourself.

For example, taking appropriate risks to grow your money in earlier years. Then, as you approach retirement, reducing your allocation to riskier assets such as equities, but increasing allocation to lower risk assets such as bonds.

**Pensions are a long-term investment. The benefits you receive depend on several factors including the value of your pot when you take your benefits. This isn't guaranteed and can go down as well as up. The value of your account could fall below the amount paid in.**

## Things to Consider

The SIPP Start-Up Fund looks to address the challenges faced by many individuals in preparing for retirement. It has been designed for individual investors looking to invest for retirement. It caters to the UK Retail Retirement market, offering simple and intuitive pension solutions.

- The fund isn't tailored to your personal circumstances, or a substitute for financial advice.
- Your own needs, objectives and characteristics may be different, so you'll need to carefully consider whether it's right for you or whether other investment options might be more appropriate.
- It's also important to review your chosen investments regularly, especially if your retirement goals change.
