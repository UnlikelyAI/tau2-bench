# Bereavement Support – Investments
_Lloyds Bank_

When someone dies, it’s important to have the right information to help you with the money side of things. Here we provide some practical steps and support to help you manage their investments.

---

## What You Need To Do

### Notify Us
Let us know who has died and try to send us the original death certificate or a copy as soon as you can. Copies can be sent to us by a registered solicitor, or someone in branch can verify a copy for you with their ID and official branch stamp.

**Please be aware:** You should not send any other sensitive information, other than the death certificate, via email. Emails are not secure and could be read by others.

- **Email:** stockbrokingbereavement@lloydsbanking.com
- **Post:** Legal Department, Lloyds Bank Direct Investments, Lovell Park Road, Leeds, LS1 1NS.

---

### Instruct Us

Once we’ve received the death certificate, the next step is to complete a form appropriate to the value of their Share Dealing account. We will issue a letter to the account’s registered address providing this information and the relevant form.

- For valuations up to **£50,000** (or up to **£36,000 in Scotland**) please complete the _Executor Authority Form – Small Estates (PDF, 152KB)_.
- For valuations of more than **£50,000**, please complete an _Executor Authority Form (PDF, 155KB)_ and send us the **Grant of Probate**.

---

## Selling or Transferring Investments

- **Sell the investments:** Normally completed within 72 hours. A cheque for the funds will be sent to the executor named on the Executor Authority Form within 10 working days.
- **Transfer investments:**
  - Transfer to another Lloyds Bank Share Dealing Account: usually takes up to 10 working days.
  - Withdrawing stock onto a certificate: can take considerably longer.

**Note:** These time frames may change if additional information is required.

You will be unable to transfer shares, withdraw available funds, or the proceeds of a sale until necessary identity and verification checks have been completed. Information about these checks can be found below and in the bereavement guide that will be sent in the post.

---

## Proof of Identity and Address

To help us identify the person dealing with the estate and before shares or funds can be released, we will carry out some identity checks. These are usually completed electronically, but if that’s not possible, we’ll ask you to send the original documentation.

You’ll need **one document from the proof of identity list** and **one document from the proof of address list.**

### Proof of Identity (examples)
- Unexpired passport (with signature)
- Unexpired UK photo driving licence (full or provisional, with signature and current address)
- UK driving licence (paper, only valid if issued up to 30 June 1998 and no photocard is held)
- Unexpired EU/EEA driving licence with photograph and signature
- UK Firearms Certificate or Shotgun Licence (unexpired)
- Unexpired EEA or equivalent National Identity Card with photograph and signature
- UK Military ID card (MOD90, current serving personnel only)
- Unexpired Biometric Residence Permit (front and back)
- UK Benefits/State Pension Notification Letters from official source, dated within last 12 months or current benefit period
- HMRC Correspondence (excluding P45/P60), dated within last 12 months

### Proof of Address (examples)
- Utility bill (last 6 months)
- Council Tax letter/statement (last 12 months)
- Unexpired UK photo card driving licence with signature and shows current address (not valid if used as proof of identity)
- Bank or Building Society statement, dated and showing transactions within the last 6 months (ISA statements not acceptable)
- Mortgage statement (last 12 months, issued by regulated financial sector firm)
- HMRC Correspondence (excluding P45/P60), dated within last 12 months
- Solicitors' correspondence relating to house purchase (last 3 months)
- Local Authority rent card/statement showing payments within last 3 months

We will also send a Bereavement Guide in the post with more details.

## Share Dealing Charges

Before you get started it’s important to understand how much you’ll pay in charges:

- **Dealing commission per stock (sales only):** £11 per online trade (UK trades only)
- **International online trades (sales only):** No dealing commission; FX rates still apply
- **Withdrawal of stock onto a certificate:** £25 per certificate

If there are funds in the Share Dealing account, these can be used to pay fees and charges. If there are not enough funds, we’ll contact the executor by letter to request payment by cheque. Dealing commission will automatically be deducted from the sale proceeds at the time of sale.

### How to Pay the Charges
To pay share dealing charges by cheque, make it payable to:
**Lloyds Bank Direct Investments** and send to:
Legal Department, Lloyds Bank Direct Investments, Lovell Park Road, Leeds, LS1 1NS.

## If You're Responsible For The Will

If you’re the executor or administrator (executor-nominate or dative in Scotland) you may have responsibility for:
- Registration of the death
- The funeral service
- Paying urgent expenses (e.g. funeral costs)
- Obtaining legal documents (grants)
- Informing financial institutions
- Listing assets and liabilities of the estate
- Paying tax liabilities (e.g. inheritance tax)
- Appointing trustees for will beneficiaries

## What To Do In Scotland

In Scotland, the laws relating to inheritance and property are different (apart from taxes). What is known as a Grant of Probate in England is called a **Grant of Confirmation** in Scotland.

A small estate in Scotland is valued at less than £36,000 and can be dealt with by private individuals, such as family members. Estates larger than £36,000, especially if property is involved, should involve a solicitor.

For support with forms and applications for a Grant of Confirmation, contact the Sheriff Clark’s office or visit the Scottish Courts Government website.

## Words or Phrases Explained

- **Assets:** Any property or possession which has a cash value.
- **Confirmation:** The process of establishing the legal right to deal with someone’s estate in Scotland (called Probate in England).
- **Current valuation:** Document confirming the value of cash/stock at the time of death, required for probate or confirmation.
- **Death certificate:** Certified copy of the entry made in the Death Register.
- **Distribution of assets:** Process of selling or transferring assets in a share dealing account as per executor instructions.
- **Grant of Probate:** Official document that may be required to administer the estate, issued by the Probate Registry.
- **Probate:** The process for handling the estate of someone who has died, including valuation, completing forms, gathering and distributing assets, and paying debts and taxes.

## What Happens Once We've Received the Death Certificate

Once we’ve received the death certificate, we will update the account and issue a letter to the registered address requesting a Grant of Probate (in Scotland, a Certificate of Confirmation) or an Executor Authority Form.

This letter includes:
- A valuation of the account
- An Executor/Administration Instruction Form

---

## Next Steps Once the Share Dealing Accounts Have Been Valued

### If the share dealing account(s) are valued at less than £50,000 (£36,000 in Scotland):
- Download the _Executor Authority Form – Small Estates Declaration & Indemnity (PDF, 81kb)_. This lets the primary executor settle the estate once the Grant of Probate (or Grant of Confirmation in Scotland) is registered with Lloyds.
- If no Grant of Probate/Confirmation is being obtained but value is less than £50,000, the form can be accepted if the Small Estates section is signed. If the estate exceeds £5,000, the Declaration must be countersigned by a solicitor.
- In Scotland, if valued at over £36,000, confirmation from the court is required.

### If the share dealing account(s) are valued at over £50,000 (£36,000 in Scotland):
- After receiving the death certificate, we will issue a letter requesting Grant of Probate (Certificate of Confirmation), including valuation and an Executor Authority Form.
- Send us the completed Executor Authority Form (PDF, 84kb) and original/certified copy of the Grant of Probate/Confirmation. Correspondence will be sent to the named executor.

---

### What Happens After I Have Sent The Instruction Forms

#### If you've requested us to sell the investments:
- Normally done within 72 hours of receiving the instruction form.
- Following market settlement, money is sent by cheque to the executor within 10 working days (may be longer if additional information is required).

#### If you've requested us to transfer the investments:
- Transfer to another Lloyds Bank Share Dealing Account: up to 10 working days.
- Withdrawal of stock onto a certificate will take longer (may depend on additional information required).
