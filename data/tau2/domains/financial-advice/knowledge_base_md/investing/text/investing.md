## Customer Stories

**Jess:**
“I've had a managed account before, so it was a good start to get that knowledge first. But now I feel more confident to pick my own. And thankfully, there’s a massive list of stocks to choose from on the Lloyds app…”

**Vanessa:**
“I was afraid of putting my money away for too long, so I used to talk myself out of investing. But when I finally started, I realised it’s a long game that’s worth it in the end…”

**Russell:**
“It’s never too late, I think if I’d started earlier, I’d be in a much better position, but it’s been great to see how things have grown, even later in life.”
