# Meet Russell | Investing | Lloyds Bank

## Yes, Russell invests

A seasoned businessman who learned the ropes of investing to reshape his finances. He started much later in life and learned a tonne of important lessons. Now he’s got to grips with it all and wants to share his newfound know-hows so others can follow in his footsteps.

### A tale of late bloomings and lightbulb moments

As a learning and development professional, Russell dedicated his life to helping others reach their full potential. But when it came to his own finances, there were still a few lessons to learn. 

He was never really interested in the financial world in his younger years. And mostly focused on his career and travelling the world. But he had an ‘aha’ moment that changed his perspective. 

Russell realised that long-term financial growth isn’t just a game of numbers – it’s the key to unlocking a life of freedom and adventure. He just wishes he’d started earlier. But being a glass-half-full kind of guy, he didn’t care that it meant playing a bit of catch-up. Better late than never, after all. 

This is Russell’s story. Imperfect, inspiring, real. Learn more about his journey and find your footing in the world of investing.

### A note to his younger self

Have you ever had a "what was I thinking?" moment? We all have, probably. When he started investing, Russell made a few spontaneous moves that he now looks back on with a pinch of humour. If he could hop into a time machine and speak to his younger self, he’d give that guy a good talking to about being careful with his money. 

“Take your time, do your homework, and don't be afraid to ask for advice." A mantra he still lives by today.

### Step off that rollercoaster – slow and steady wins the race 

It’s easy to fall into the trap of ‘quick wins’ when it comes to investing. So you might be tempted to go for stocks that tend to make money fast. But Russell learned the hard way that longer term products could work out better. Now he’s a fan of less adventurous investments because they feel a lot more stable.

Russell learned that a little success in investing can go to one's head. You might feel invincible after making a lot of money on an investment. But he's quick to remind himself (and anyone who'll listen) that if you’re not a pro investor, practice humility and keep a level head. 

Russell's story is a refreshing reminder that it's never too late to take control of your finances and create a brighter future.

### It’s about financial freedom (and maybe a nice holiday)

For Russell, financial security isn't about hoarding money. It’s about freedom. It makes it easier for him to pursue his passions, explore new places and enjoy life on his own terms.

Russell isn’t afraid to poke fun at his younger self's decisions. He's learned some expensive lessons from every pound spent – like the flashy sports car he once splurged on. But through this, he gained valuable insight into himself and the financial world.

Russell would like his story to be a reminder that it's never too late to take control of your money and your spending habits.

## Real investing tips from real investors

Russell’s had his ups and downs with money, but he’s never let the pitfalls stop him from getting back up. Here are a few lessons he’d like to share to get you going:

- You don’t need to know everything about investing to get started – slow and steady can work wonders
- It’s best not to think of investing as a get-rich-quick scheme, but rather as a way of creating long-term financial freedom and independence
- Find a provider who knows a thing or two about investing successfully, like Lloyds'
- There’s a tonne of information out there so it can be hard to zero in on what’s relevant to you, but the right firm can make it a lot simpler (you can start with Lloyds’ [Understanding Investing])

### Please remember

> The value of investments and the income from them can fall as well as rise, and you may get back less than you invest. If you’re not sure about investing, seek financial advice. There will normally be a charge for that advice. Tax treatment depends on individual circumstances and may be subject to change in the future.

### Meet Jess

> “I've had a managed investing account before, so it was a good start to get that knowledge first. But now I feel more confident to pick my own. And thankfully, there’s a massive list of stocks to choose from on the Lloyds app...”

### Meet Vanessa

> “I was afraid of putting my money away for too long, so I used to talk myself out of investing. But when I finally started, I realised it’s a long game that’s worth it in the end…”
