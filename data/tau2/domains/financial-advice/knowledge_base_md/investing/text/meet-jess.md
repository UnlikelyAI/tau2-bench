# Meet Jess | Investing | Lloyds Bank

## Yes, Jess invests

At first, Jess thought investing was only for experts. But she eased in slowly with a small savings account before she began exploring investments. Now, she’s focused on making sure her future’s taken care of.

### A journey from savings to stocks

You’ve probably already heard it said a million times by now – ‘start investing as early as you can’. But let’s be honest. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed if you’ve never tried it. Too many big words, too little sense. Not sure how much money should go into which pot… Well, cosy up with your best mug because Jess has the tea.

She always felt like there was no one in the media that young people, particularly women, could look up to for investing. Despite the lack of representation, she decided to rise above the self-doubt and take on the markets. And her mum being from the Philippines, a very matriarchal society, meant she had a strong female presence in her life to look up to. One that taught her how to handle her money better.

As a young woman in her 20s with no real background in finance, Jess still made investing work for her. She sat down with us to share her experience and hopefully give others the confidence to do it too.

### Even a little nest egg can hatch big dreams

Jess’s goal was clear from the start: financial freedom. As an independent artist, she wanted to make sure she could still take care of herself when work was scarce. Something she hadn’t learned yet at uni.

> “I think a lot of students are the same. We had no idea about budgeting. Everything was all over the place. My flatmates and I would get so broke to the point that we’d come back home and all the lights would be off because nobody knew how to manage their money.”

She wanted to fix this. So she started small with a savings account to ease into the habit of putting money aside. And as her savings grew, so did her confidence.

But big dreams have small beginnings. So when it came to investing, she started off by wading into the shallow end with managed funds and simple options and bonds. (Learn all the jargon here.)

### The art-ist of patience

One of Jess’s biggest lessons? Resist the urge to tweak. She learned the hard way that constantly moving your money around isn’t worth the trouble, it’s best to keep your money in your account to get the most out of the investment.

> “Just pace yourself. See how long you can keep money invested without touching it.”

## Real investing tips from real investors

Jess will be the first to admit she enjoys a little splurge here and there. But she’s learned lots of lessons about managing money along the way. So here are a few of her takeaways to get you going:

- As you’re young, time is on your side, so it’s good to start building strong saving habits now
- ‘Categorise’ your income into different accounts to control your spending, like having one for needs, another for wants and of course, a savings account
- You don’t need lots of money to start investing, but building a steady habit and contributing to your account monthly could pay off – just make sure your needs are taken care of first
- Do your research before investing in anything; there’s tonnes of information online that can help you get started (like this guide)
- Make sure you choose the right investments for your goals, and only put in what you can afford to leave in over the longer term (5+ years)

> “I was afraid of putting my money away for too long, so I used to talk myself out of investing. But when I finally started, I realised it’s a long game that’s worth it in the end…”

### Meet Russell

> “It’s never too late, I think if I’d started earlier, I’d be in a much better position, but it’s been great to see how things have grown, even later in life.”
