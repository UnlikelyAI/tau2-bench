# Resilient Investing: Navigating Stock Market Volatility

We’re all seeing the impact that US tariff announcements are having on the stock market and, naturally, we start wondering how this can affect our investments.

While generally we may be seeing drops in investment performance in the short term, it’s important to remember that over time the stock market often goes through periods of volatility which can be caused by political and economic changes like we saw during the Covid pandemic or are seeing at the moment in the US.

This uncertainty or volatility is typically short lived. And, when it comes to investing taking a long term view is important as it allows time to ride out these short-term shifts.

We know that can be unsettling, however, it's normal for stock markets to move up and down over the short term.

## When Facing Market Volatility…

It’s natural to feel uncertain when the stock market experiences a downturn. But, knowing how to act when the market fluctuates could help you prepare for any future surprises.

The knee-jerk reaction might be to ask, “Should I sell?” instead, consider asking yourself: “What shouldn’t I do?”

The answer is simple:
**Don’t panic!**

Here are some essential principles to keep in mind when facing market volatility:

### Invest for the Long Term

- Remember that investing is a marathon, not a sprint.
- Market fluctuations are part of investing, and trying to time the market rarely works in your favour.
- Stay focused on your long-term goals and avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market movements.

### Know Your Risk Appetite

- Before investing, check your risk appetite.
- Factors, for instance, how long you’re willing to invest, financial needs and emotional response to losses play an important role.
- Understand that risk appetite varies from person to person and may be different for each investment aim/goal you have.
- Some investors can tolerate higher volatility, while others prefer more stability. The longer you can invest, the more risk you might be willing to take.
- So, you could pick a medium-risk investment if saving for a shorter-term goal, such as for a house deposit.
- Or pick a higher-risk investment, if you’re saving for the long-term such as for your retirement. Or a combination of both.

### Diversify Your Portfolio

- Diversification is your best defence against market crashes.
- Spread your investments across different asset classes (such as stocks, bonds, property) to reduce risk. We offer a range of different stocks to choose from or if you have one of our Ready-Made products, these already invests across these asset types.
- A well-diversified portfolio will feel the impact less if a single market sector falls.

### Stay Informed but Avoid Overreacting

- Keep an eye on market news and economic indicators, but don’t let short-term headlines dictate your investment decisions.
- Emotional reactions often lead to selling at the wrong time. Trust your long-term strategy and avoid knee-jerk responses.

### Prepare for Losses

- Market fluctuations mean that losses (like gains) are part of investing. Instead of fearing them, have a solid risk management strategy in place.
- Some of our products have TradePlans available to help limit potential losses. These tools automatically trigger based on an instruction you set. TradePlans can be used on UK shares, Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and Investments Trusts.
