Unlocking Global Opportunities: International Investing at a Glance

International investing means buying global investments, such as shares, funds, and ETFs (exchange-traded funds). It allows you to expand your portfolio beyond the borders of your home country and tap into foreign markets.

## What’s in it for you?

There are several key benefits to expanding your portfolio beyond borders by investing internationally. Such as:

- **Tap into a wider range of market performance** with international investing. It also spreads investment risk, reducing potential losses by balancing market changes across different countries.

- **Capitalising on global expertise.** Different countries often excel in different industries and sectors. Investing internationally allows you to take advantage of the strengths of these different markets.

- **New areas of opportunity.** It gives you investment opportunities in areas that don’t exist when investing in the UK, such as investing in Emerging Markets.

## What do you need to consider before investing internationally?

While the principal stays the same, there are some different risks involved. Sometimes, the risks may be greater. For example:

- **Currency**
  Any potential profit or loss from your trade in foreign markets may be affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.

- **Economy**
  The general economic outlook and market conditions may differ considerably between the UK and foreign markets causing them to be less – or more – favourable.

- **Taxation**
  Tax laws vary in different countries, so you’ll need to check our website to see if any additional tax charges apply.
