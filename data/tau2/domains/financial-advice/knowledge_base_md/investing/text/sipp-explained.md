## Interest Rates for Self-Invested Personal Pension (SIPP)

### How Interest Works

- Cash balances of **£1 or more** earn interest.
- **Current Gross Rate:** **3.55%**
- This rate can change in the future.

### How Lloyds Handles the Money

- All cash is held in a **central client money account**.
- Lloyds earns interest from banking partners and retains **0.80% to 1.30%** (retained interest) to improve products and services.
- The remainder is paid to you at the stated rate.

### Calculating & Paying Interest

- Interest is calculated daily and paid **yearly in March**.
- Interest rates are variable.

#### **Current interest paid:**

| From        | Interest rate paid to you |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| 18/11/2024  | 3.55%                    |

### Additional Information

- Uninvested cash is held in a central client money account in compliance with FCA rules.
- Money is protected under the **Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS)**.
- Retained interest is the difference between the total received from banking partners and the amount paid to customers.
- All interest rates can vary.

---

## Tax Relief

- If you’re **under age 75** and eligible, personal SIPP contributions receive **immediate tax relief at the basic rate** (**20%** for 2025/26).
- **Example:** Pay in **£8,000**; HMRC tops up with **£2,000** → **Total contribution: £10,000**.
- Higher rate taxpayers can claim additional tax relief from HMRC via annual tax return; Lloyds does not add this directly.
- Contributions and tax relief visible online/in app, cash investable within three working days.

## What Happens When You Die?

- Your SIPP can be passed to beneficiaries, usually **free from Inheritance Tax**.
- Beneficiaries’ options:
  - **Cash lump sum**
  - **Annuity:** Guaranteed yearly income from an annuity provider
  - **Beneficiary drawdown:** Flexible income, with remaining funds passable to future generations
- Some benefits may be taxed depending on how benefits are accessed and circumstances at your death.

### Death Before Age 75

- Cash lump sum and income death benefits are normally paid **tax-free**, **if paid within two years of notification and within Lump Sum Death Benefits Allowance (LSDBA)**.
- **2025/26 LSDBA Limit:** **£1,073,100**
- LSDBA reduces by previous withdrawals.
- Death benefits via beneficiary drawdown are *not* subject to the LSDBA.

### Death After Age 75

- Benefits are **subject to tax at the beneficiary’s marginal rate**.
- Tax effect varies based on how funds are accessed (e.g. as lump sum vs. drawn income).

**Example:**
If your beneficiary earns £30,000 a year and inherits £50,000, they could withdraw £10,000/year, taxed at 20%, instead of taking the full amount as a (heavily taxed) lump sum.

**Remember:**
- Pension and tax rules can change, and any benefits depend on individual circumstances.
- You can nominate multiple beneficiaries and update them easily online or via the app.

## Taking Money from Your Pension

From **age 55 (57 from 2028)**, you have flexible access to your SIPP savings.

### Options:

- **Leave it invested:** Maintain your SIPP for as long as you wish.
- **Flexibility through drawdown (Flexi-access drawdown):** Take up to 25% tax-free, then withdraw further sums as you choose.
- **Take a taxable lump sum (Uncrystallised Funds Pension Lump Sum - UFPLS):** Withdraw as much/little as you like, with 25% of each withdrawal tax-free.
- **Buy an annuity:** Take up to 25% tax-free, use the remainder to buy a guaranteed lifetime regular income (must transfer to an annuity provider).

---

### Things to Consider

- **Lump Sum Allowance (LSA):**
  - For **2025/26**: **£268,275**
  - Tax-free lump sums limited to 25% of pension value, up to the LSA maximum (unless other pension protections exist).
- **Money Purchase Annual Allowance (MPAA):**
  - When you start taking income (drawdown or taxable lump sum), future contributions above **£10,000/year** may incur a tax charge (subject to government policy changes).

## Understanding the Risks

### Transferring Risks

- Transferring from another scheme could mean loss of valuable benefits or features.
- Existing providers may charge penalties or reduce benefit values.
- Seek professional advice if unsure.

### Investment Risks

- Wide investment range, each with different risk levels.
- Values can go up or down; you may get back less than you invested.
- Smaller pot sizes with regular dealing may incur costly fees relative to value.

### Retirement Benefit Risks

- Income is not guaranteed; taking income early or in large amounts may not meet retirement needs and could raise tax liabilities.
- The SIPP pot may not sustain your retirement if withdrawn at high rates.

---

## Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS)

- Eligible deposits protected up to **£85,000** per person per firm.

---

## Additional Information

_Pensions are a long-term investment. The value of your pension pot can go down as well as up, and may be less than you paid in. Tax treatment depends on personal circumstances and may change in the future._
