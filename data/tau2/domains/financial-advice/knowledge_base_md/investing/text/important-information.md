## Things to Consider Before Investing

### Regulatory information

This website contains links to sites operated by persons outside our group of companies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices, content or the products and services provided through these sites.

The information within this site is based on our understanding of current law and practice and is subject to any changes of legislation or regulations.

#### Financial Conduct Authority

At Lloyds Bank Share Dealing, we believe that this site tells you what you need to know to make an informed decision about our products.

If you'd like more general information, the FCA, the financial services regulator, provides a range of free consumer booklets and factsheets and a Consumer Helpline.

Website: [https://www.fca.org.uk](https://www.fca.org.uk)
Helpline: 0300 500 8082

The FCA can only give general information and cannot recommend the products of any company.

### Market Abuse

The Market Abuse Regulation which came into effect on 3rd July 2016 expressly prohibits insider dealing, market manipulation and misleading behaviour. Making statements or spreading rumours through the mass media or otherwise (e.g. internet chat rooms or forums) which give or are likely to give a regular user of the stockmarket false or misleading impressions as to the supply of or demand for a listed share, can be a criminal offence.

#### Three main types of market abuse:

1. **Misuse of information**
   Behaviour based on information which is not generally available, which if known, would be relevant to an investor's dealings in a particular stock.

2. **Creating a false or misleading impression**
   Behaviour likely to give a false or misleading impression with regard to the supply and demand, or the price or value of an investment or stock.

3. **Distorting the market**
   Behaving in a way that leads to the manipulation of the price of an investment.

Further information: [https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/markets/market-abuse](https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/markets/market-abuse) or call 0300 500 8082.

### Legalised Cannabis Industry

In some circumstances, investing in or receiving returns on investments in certain companies (or funds which include investments in certain companies) may be an offence under UK anti-money laundering legislation if the company’s activities abroad were illegal if carried out in the UK. An example would be companies involved in the legalised cannabis industry abroad. Please ensure you carry out careful due diligence on these types of investments before investing. If you have any concerns please seek independent legal advice.

### Financial and Trade Sanctions

If you are planning to directly or indirectly engage in any form of business, or to remit or receive funds (in any currency) that may involve the countries with financial trade sanctions imposed on them, or an individual or entity who has been specially designated - please contact us beforehand, as transactions could otherwise be delayed, rejected, or frozen.

### Penalties

The Financial Conduct Authority has the power to impose an unlimited financial penalty on any individual (whether or not they are employed in the financial sector) where it can be proven that market abuse has occurred.

## Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS)

**How safe are my assets?**

Your stock and cash are safe as there are two layers of protection; segregation of assets and the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS).

- **Asset segregation:** Customer assets are segregated from the firm’s assets and would be available to be returned to you in the unlikely event that we were to cease trading.
- **FSCS protection:** In the extremely unlikely event of this segregation failing, you would be able to claim under the FSCS up to a value of **£85,000**.

**Halifax Share Dealing Limited and Embark Investment Services Limited** are both participants in the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.

Customers categorised as a retail client may be able to make a claim on this scheme if either default in their obligations to them. Compensation of up to **100% of the first £85,000** of assets held with each legal entity may be available to eligible claimants.

The limit for each legal entity is applied to the aggregated total of any stock or cash held across all products and brands they provide.

For further information visit [http://www.fscs.org.uk/](http://www.fscs.org.uk/)

### Security of Customers' Assets – Segregation

- **Stock:** All customer stock held by us is registered into the name of a nominee company controlled by us. This is a non-trading company and the record of accounts clearly identifies those stocks as being held on behalf of customers.
- **Cash:** All customer money is held in bank accounts specifically designated as holding client money. This clearly distinguishes client money accounts from those accounts maintained by us for our own money.

In the event of our insolvency customer stock and cash would be ring-fenced. The administrative receiver, who would need to be approved by the Financial Conduct Authority, would be prevented from distributing the assets from these accounts to anyone other than the customers to whom it belonged.

## How We Execute Orders

We factor in a number of criteria, including:
- price,
- speed,
- likelihood of execution,
- likelihood of settlement,
- costs,
- size,
- and other relevant factors.

**Price and speed are the two primary factors.**
All customers are treated in the same way.

For information on our policy that outlines how we execute your orders, see our current **Order Execution Policy**.

---

## Value Assessments

- We regularly review data from investment managers to ensure funds continue to meet internal and regulatory standards.
- Managers declaring that their investments fall below the standard may have them removed from sale, until they improve. Existing investments can still be held.

**What is a Value Assessment?**
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) requires investment managers to produce a ‘value assessment’ with measures including:
- Quality of service
- Fund performance
- Cost of funds
- Comparable market rates
- Economies of scale
- Comparable services
- Unit classes

The investment manager should state whether their fund provides value overall.
