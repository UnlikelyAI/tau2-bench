# Tax and ISA Changes

This information has been prepared for basic information purposes only and is aimed at UK taxpayers. The actual tax you would have to pay will depend on other income and investments and personal circumstances. This is not intended to provide, nor should it be relied on for tax advice. Tax treatment depends on individual circumstances and may be subject to change in the future.

## ISA Subscriptions

ISA Subscriptions allow you to save a set amount of money each tax year that is protected against UK Capital Gains and Dividends tax. The amount is **£20,000 for the 2025/26 tax year.**

You can subscribe to multiple ISAs of the same type (except for Lifetime ISA) within the tax year. All subscriptions must stay within the overall ISA limit of £20,000.

## Capital Gains Tax

### What is Capital Gains Tax and how does it affect the sales of investments?

Capital Gains Tax (CGT) is a tax on the profit you make when you sell or dispose of an asset that has increased in value. It’s important to note that it’s the gain that’s taxable, not the total amount you receive from the sale.

When you sell shares, the gain is calculated by subtracting the original purchase price (including any related costs) from the selling price. In the UK, individuals have a yearly CGT allowance, which is **£3,000 for the 2025/26 tax year.** Gains up to this amount are free of CGT. Any gains above this threshold are taxed at rates depending on your income tax band.

### How does the 2024 Autumn Budget affect the CGT you pay?

The recent Autumn Budget has increased capital gains tax (CGT) rates from 30 October 2024.

- For **basic-rate taxpayers, the CGT rate has increased from 10% to 18%**
- For **higher-rate taxpayers the rate is now 24%, up from 20%**

Note that when the gain is added to your income it may move you to a higher rate tax band. These changes apply to the gains you make that are above your yearly CGT allowance from the sale of investments **not held in an ISA**.

### Which investments in my Lloyds account may attract CGT?

- Shares
- Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)
- Funds
- Investment Trusts
- Bonds

Gilts have a CGT exemption meaning you do not pay Capital Gains Tax when you sell Gilts.

### Strategies to Mitigate Capital Gains Tax on sales of investments

Capital Gains Tax (CGT) can significantly impact the returns on your investments. However, here are some things you could consider to mitigate your CGT liability when selling investments:

- **Use Tax-Efficient Accounts:**
  Capital Gains Tax is not applicable to investments sold from within an Individual Savings Account (ISA) or a Self-Invested Personal Pension (SIPP). If your investments are held outside an ISA, you can use a process called Bed and ISA to sell those shares to realise a gain and then immediately buy them back within an ISA. This way further gains on these investments won’t attract CGT.

- **Utilise Your Annual Exemption:**
  Each tax year, you have a yearly CGT exemption (£3,000 for the 2025/26 tax year). By spreading the sale of shares across multiple tax years, you can make full use of this exemption.

- **Transfer Assets to a Spouse or Civil Partner:**
  Transfers between spouses or civil partners are exempt from CGT. This allows you to use both individuals’ yearly exemptions, effectively doubling your tax-free allowance.

- **Offset Gains with Losses:**
  If you have incurred losses on other investments, you may be able to use these to offset gains, reducing your overall CGT liability.

We’ve discussed some of the things you can consider to help manage your CGT liability, ensuring your investment returns are tax-efficient.

However, it's important to consult with a financial adviser or tax adviser to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and ensure compliance with current tax laws. Information correct at 07 April 2025.

> **Please note:** Not all investments are liable for Capital Gains Tax and there are separate Capital Gains Tax rules for selling properties, which are also detailed on the Government website.

## Dividend Tax Allowance

### What is tax on Dividends?

Everyone has a Dividend Allowance, which is **£500 for the 2025/26 tax year.** This means you can earn up to the allowance in dividends each tax year without owing tax.

Dividends are a portion of a company’s profits that are paid to its investors. The rate of tax you owe on dividends will depend on your income tax band.

For example:

- If you receive **£2,900** worth of dividends in the 2025/26 tax year, £500 of those would fall within your Dividend allowance and wouldn’t be taxed. This leaves £2,400 that would be liable for tax.

  - In the 2025/26 tax year:
    - A **basic rate taxpayer** would owe **8.75% (£210)**
    - A **higher rate taxpayer** would owe **33.75% (£810)**
    - An **additional rate taxpayer** would owe **39.35% (£944.40)**

### ISAs protect your investments from tax on your dividends

Any dividends on investments held within an ISA are not liable for tax on dividends. You can move your existing investments into an ISA by a process referred to as 'Bed and ISA'.

More information can be found about tax on dividends on the Government website.
