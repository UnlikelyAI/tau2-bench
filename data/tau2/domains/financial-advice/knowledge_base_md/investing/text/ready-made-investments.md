# Lloyds Bank Ready-Made Investments

Investments built and managed by our experts. They’re a great way to start if you’re not sure or want help deciding which funds to pick. We’ve done the hard work for you.

---

## Benefits

- **Flexible ways to invest**
  Choose how much to invest. Start with £50 a month or a £500 one-off amount. And pick the level of risk you want.

- **Easy and hassle-free**

## The new tax year is here

The new tax year has started, which means a new £20,000 ISA allowance. This can be used across all ISA types, including our Ready-Made Investment ISA.

---

## How does it work?

- **Pick your risk level:**
  You can pick from three funds to best suit you – cautious, balanced or progressive. You can change this in the future if your circumstances or view of risk changes.

- **Choose an account:**
  Open an Investment ISA or an Investment Account.

- **Decide how much to invest:**
  Start from £50 a month or £500 as a lump sum.

  > Keep in mind, investing in stocks and shares is a longer-term commitment and it is not a substitute for cash savings. We recommend you leave your money invested for around five years. You should still make sure you have 'rainy day' cash savings to cover unplanned expenses and emergencies.

- **Track your performance:**
  Track and top up your ready-made portfolio using Internet Banking or our app. Just like your everyday banking.

> Please remember that the value of investments and the income from them can fall as well as rise, and you may get back less than you invest. If you’re not sure about investing, seek financial advice. There will normally be a charge for that advice. Tax treatment depends on individual circumstances and may be subject to change in the future.
