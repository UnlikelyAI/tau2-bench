## Understanding the Charges

These charges are based on the value of your total investment.

- **The service fee** is 0.24% (capped at £36). It is calculated monthly (minimum of 20p per month) based on the total value of your investment and is then paid to us once a year. This fee covers our costs for managing your account.
- **The ongoing charge** is charged by the fund manager for their services and is built into the total value of the fund.
- **Transaction costs** are incurred when the fund manager buys and sells investments within the fund. These costs are built into the fund’s value.
