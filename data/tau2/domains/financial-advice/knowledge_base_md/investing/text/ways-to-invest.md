## Important Information

> Please remember that the value of investments and the income from them can fall as well as rise, and you may get back less than you invest. If you’re not sure about investing, seek financial advice. There will normally be a charge for that advice. Tax treatment depends on individual circumstances and may be subject to change in the future.
