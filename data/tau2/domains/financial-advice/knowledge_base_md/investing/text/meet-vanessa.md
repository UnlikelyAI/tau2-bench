### Flipping the Script

If there’s anyone who knows a thing or two about stealing the show, it’s Vanessa. A seasoned pro in the world of lights, camera and action. But her most impressive performance is how she overcame her financial fears to build a portfolio worthy of a silver screening.

Vanessa's journey into the world of investing began after a difficult time in her life. When she was just a teenager, her father sadly passed away, leaving her mum on her own without a steady income. This experience left Vanessa with a long-lasting fear of financial insecurity.

Determined to write a fresh chapter in her story, Vanessa took her financial future firmly into her own hands. We chatted with her to learn how she flipped the script to become the money-savvy woman she is today.

### Filling up Piggy Banks and Climbing up Property Ladders

Vanessa made the smart decision to start investing early with an ISA. But this artiste is no one-trick pony. As she became comfortable with setting money aside, she added more complex products.

Now she invests in all sorts of things – from stocks and bonds to government saving schemes to property. (Read this guide to learn more about these).

Her secret weapon isn’t just her never-ending quest for knowledge, but also a supportive community. She turned to finance gurus and communities designed to empower people of colour in the world of finance.

Vanessa's story is a testament to the power of facing your fears, embracing knowledge and building a steady investing habit to secure your future. It's a reminder that taking control of your money is within everyone's reach, whatever your background or profession.

## Please remember

> The value of investments and the income from them can fall as well as rise, and you may get back less than you invest. If you’re not sure about investing, seek financial advice. There will normally be a charge for that advice. Tax treatment depends on individual circumstances and may be subject to change in the future.
