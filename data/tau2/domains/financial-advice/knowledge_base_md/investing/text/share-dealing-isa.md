## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I have more than one Share Dealing ISA?

Yes, from 6 April 2024 you can subscribe to more than one of any type of ISA including Stocks and Shares ISAs (except for Lifetime ISAs). Just remember to stay within the yearly tax-free ISA allowance.

### Do you pay UK tax on a Share Dealing ISA?

No, that’s one of the best things about a Share Dealing ISA. Any dividends and interest payments from your shares are free from UK Income Tax. You also won’t need to pay Capital Gains Tax on any gains from your investments.

### Can I transfer a cash ISA to a Share Dealing ISA?

Yes, you can. When you transfer, the cash will stay in your account until you choose to invest it. You can transfer an existing Lloyds Bank cash ISA or a cash ISA from another provider to one of our Share Dealing ISAs.

### How risky are Share Dealing ISAs?

As with all investments, there is risk involved with a Share Dealing ISA. It’s important to remember that the value of investments and the income from them can fall and rise. Before taking out any investment product, you’ll need to be clear with how you feel about risk and how able you are to take losses.

### What is a dividend?

A dividend is a payment made from a company to those who have bought and hold their shares, usually when a company has made a profit. If you do not invest within an ISA, you may pay tax on any amount over the dividend allowance.

### What is Capital Gains Tax (CGT)?

Capital Gains Tax is tax you pay on any gains you’ve made from selling assets (such as shares). If you invest through an ISA, you will not pay this tax on any gains made through your investments.
