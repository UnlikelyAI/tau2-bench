> Please remember that the value of investments and the income from them can fall as well as rise, and you may get back less than you invest. If you’re not sure about investing, seek financial advice. There will normally be a charge for this. Tax treatment depends on individual circumstances and current UK tax rules.

## What Happens After You Initiate Your Transfer?

Transfers are generally made up of five steps. Complex transfers may differ, but we’ll make sure to keep you updated along the way.

For a typical transfer in of UK shares:

1. **Logging:** You make us aware that you want to transfer.
2. **Valuation:** We‘ll contact your existing broker and ask about your account.
3. **Accept / confirm:** Your existing broker will reply to us with an inventory of your account with them.
4. **Arrange:** We check that we can accept your stock and give your existing broker the go-ahead. We then arrange with them what date your holdings will be transferred.
5. **Completion:** We receive your holdings and shortly after any cash. Then we process them into your account.

## How to Transfer Out to Another Broker

If you want to transfer your account to another provider, you’ll need to contact your new provider to initiate the transfer.

- There are **no charges to transfer your account to another provider**, but any outstanding admin charges must be paid.
- If you request us to sell stock and transfer cash you’ll be charged the usual telephone dealing commission charges for the sale(s). To reduce this cost, you could place the sales online and then separately request the transfer.

**Please note:**
The money within an ISA only keeps its tax-free or tax-efficient status if it’s kept within an ISA at all times. If you want to transfer money between two ISAs then this needs to be completed by the two ISA Managers. If you withdraw cash from an ISA at any point, it will lose its tax-free or tax-efficient status.

## What Happens if I’m Transferring Funds from Another Broker?

If you’re transferring funds to us from another broker, we might hold a different fund class than the one you hold now. This means we may need to convert your fund into a class that can be transferred, which may be more expensive or could be cheaper.

We do this to make sure your fund does not have to be sold as part of the transfer. Once the transfer is complete, we’ll make sure that you hold the cheapest fund class we have available for investment.
