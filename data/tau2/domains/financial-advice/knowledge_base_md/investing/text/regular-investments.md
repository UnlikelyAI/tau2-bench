# Lloyds Bank Regular Investment Plan

Investing smaller amounts regularly can be an easier way to grow your money without needing a lump sum. Plus, you don't pay any trading fees when you invest within a regular investment plan, so more of your money can go into your investment.

---

## Why invest regularly?

- **Pound cost averaging:** Regular contributions can help you ride out the ups and downs of the market.
- **No trading fees:** A regular investment plan carries no trading fees, so more of your money can keep working for you.
- **Consistency:** Regular investing makes it easier to stay consistent and stick to your financial goals in the long run.
- **Compounding:** Saving over the longer term means you can get returns from the money you've made in previous years (provided you re-invest them), accelerating your growth.

## How does it work?

1. **Start your subscription**
   In your chosen account, select `'Dealing’`, then `'Regular investments'` and `'Create subscription plan'`.

2. **Set up your free investment plan**
   Select `'Create investment plan'` and decide **how much**, **how often**, and **when** you want to invest.

3. **Pick your investments**
   Select `'Add investments'` and make your choices, using either the investment name or company code.
   Finally, add the amount you want to invest in each.

> Please remember that the value of investments and the income from them can fall as well as rise, and you may get back less than you invest. If you’re not sure about investing, seek financial advice. There will normally be a charge for this. Tax treatment depends on individual circumstances and current UK tax rules.

## Benefits

### Steady Growth

Investing in regular instalments can provide some protection if the market suddenly drops. A monthly investment will buy fewer shares or fund units when markets rise and more shares or units when markets fall. In falling markets, that means you can buy more shares at a cheaper price.

### Build Good Habits

Regular investing is an affordable way to pursue your financial goals and benefit from 'compounding'. Here, you earn returns from both your original investment and again on returns you previously received, provided you re-invest them.

### Keep Things Simple

With modern investing, there's no need to keep track of the markets. By making regular investments, you'll be better placed to ride out any lows and take advantage of the highs. Regular investing is key to long-term growth, and with our regular investment plan, carries zero trading charges. So, more of your money can work for you.
