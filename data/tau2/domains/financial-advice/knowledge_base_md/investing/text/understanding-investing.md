**Time in the market versus timing the market.**

Sounds similar, but are very different strategies to invest your money.

This episode of BlackRock Basics is going to answer the age-old question: Does time in the market beat timing the market?

So grab something to drink, maybe a little snack, and let's get into it!

**Timing the market** means trying to identify exactly when to buy stocks, bonds or other assets, and when to sell them.
If you're able to buy at the lowest price and sell at the highest price, you should in theory be able to maximise your investment returns.

This sounds ideal, but in reality, it's super difficult to know when the price of a stock or a bond has reached its cheapest level and is about to rise, or when it's reached its highest level and is about to fall. It's really tough to achieve this once, and almost impossible to do it consistently over the long-term.

So, if trying to time the market is proving difficult, what other options do you have?

**Time in the market** is all about keeping money invested over the long-term, and not about trying to buy low and sell high. History shows us that this can result in better returns and lower the risk of investing a lump sum of money just before markets fall.

Investing a consistent amount on a regular basis is a popular strategy used by investors who want to grow their money over the long-term and reduce the risk of timing an investment incorrectly.
One of the easiest ways to achieve this is by drip feeding your investments. Instead of parting ways with a lump sum, you can opt to automatically invest a set amount of money each month.

Not only does this eliminate guesswork involved in deciding when to invest, it should also help you ride out the market highs and lows, allowing for a smoother journey.

Let’s use an analogy:

So imagine you're on a treasure hunt on a desert island. And you're presented with two choices to find said treasure.

- **Option one:** You can try to predict exactly where the treasure is buried and dig in that spot, given the knowledge you have of its supposed location. But a sandstorm changes the beach layout and now everything is changed. How will you find the treasure now?
  *This is like timing the market. You're making an educated guess in the hopes of striking gold immediately. But other forces you could have not predicted have shattered your dreams.*

- **Option two:** You can explore the entire island, digging in different spots over a longer period.
  *This is like time in the market. You're consistently searching and giving yourselves more opportunities to find the treasure and weather storms.*

This analogy is a great way to showcase why time in the market beats timing the market. In the same way that searching for the treasure presented unpredictable challenges, so too can the market. By exploring the island and digging in several areas, you increase your chances of potentially finding the treasure, even if it takes time, no matter what is thrown at you.

So instead of worrying about finding the perfect spot to dig, why not enjoy the hunt and hopefully let time lead you to the treasure.

**Please remember that the value of investments and the income from them can fall as well as rise, and you may get back less than you invest. If you’re not sure about investing, seek financial advice. There will normally be a charge for that advice. Tax treatment depends on individual circumstances and may be subject to change in the future.**
