## How do I trade US shares?

If you want to trade US shares there are 2 things you need to do first. This needs to be completed in the order shown below.

**Please remember that the value of investments and the income from them, can fall as well as rise and you may get back less than you invest. If you’re not sure about investing, seek independent advice. There will normally be a charge for that advice. Tax treatment depends on individual circumstances and may be subject to change in the future.**

### 1. Complete the relevant tax form

**a) A non-US person such as a UK resident would ordinarily complete a W-8BEN.**

**b) A US person would ordinarily complete a W-9:**

#### How long is it valid for?

The W-8BEN form is valid for three calendar years following the year in which you sign it, unless your personal circumstances change. Please let us know within 30 days if this happens. We will contact you when your form is due to expire.

#### Once you’ve completed your form you’ll need to send it to us.

**Send from your personal computer:**
Complete and sign the document on your computer using Adobe Sign, then email the completed document to us.

**Send from your phone:**
If you’re an Apple user, you can use Markup to complete the form.
If you use Android, you can use apps like the Adobe Fill and Sign app to edit the form.
Once completed, email it to us.

**Send by post:**

### 2. Complete the NYSE subscriber agreement

Once the W-8BEN form has been registered on your account, you can place your international trade. Log on to your share dealing account, select 'dealing' from the right hand menu and choose the Int'l tab.

The first time you trade, a NYSE agreement will pop up. Once you've completed the form and confirmed that you are not a professional investor, you will be able to trade immediately.

The NYSE agreement will only appear the first time an international trade is placed. If your circumstances change you will need to contact us.

#### Why do you need to complete a US tax form and NYSE subscriber agreement?

Before you can buy US shares (or if you’re receiving income from the US), you must complete an IRS tax form. For trades on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), we are required to declare your status as either a non-professional or professional investor. We may share your personal information with NYSE if they request confirmation of your status as a non-professional investor.

## Risks involved with international shares

Dealing on foreign markets will involve different risks from UK markets - in some cases the risks may be greater.

| Risk Factor         | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **Culture**                  | Language and cultural differences between the UK and foreign markets may mean a lack of information or difficulty in obtaining information important to your trading decisions. |
| **Currency Risks**           | Any potential profit or loss from your trade may be affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. |
| **Economy and Politics**     | Economic or political factors, such as inflation or interest rate fluctuations in the UK, could affect overseas markets. The general economic outlook and market conditions may differ considerably. |
| **Emerging Markets**         | Emerging markets tend to be less developed, leading to greater volatility. The value of your investments could change quickly. |
| **Shareholder Rights**       | As a shareholder, you may be excluded from some rights and benefits because you reside in a different jurisdiction. You may not be treated in the same way as other shareholders and could suffer losses. |
| **Taxation**                 | Tax laws overseas differ from those in the UK. Overseas tax authorities may withhold more tax. ISAs and SIPPs will only shelter you from UK tax. Overseas tax could affect the value and returns of foreign investments. |
| **Trading and Settlement**   | Foreign markets may trade at lower volumes, making it harder to sell shares. This could also cause settlement delays. |

## International Charges

We’ve removed our dealing commission fee for online trades across six international markets. Foreign exchange rates still apply (1%).

Our currency conversion fee takes away 1% from the exchange rate for buys, and adds 1% for sales. An indicative exchange rate will be shown prior to trading and the final rate will be shown once the trade is completed.

[See our full list of charges (PDF, 87 KB)](https://)

### How is the foreign exchange charge worked out?

Below is an example of how the foreign exchange charge is calculated:

- You buy 10 shares in a company valued at $100.00 per share. At the time the trade is placed, the £/$ exchange rate is 1.5200.

| Calculation | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Cost of shares | 10 x $100.00 = $1,000.00 |
| Cost of shares in GBP | $1,000.00 / 1.52 = £657.89 |
| FX rate with FX charge added (1%) | 1% of 1.52 = 0.0152; 1.52 – 0.0152 = 1.5048 |
| Cost of shares in GBP including FX charge | $1,000 / 1.5048 = £664.54 |
| FX cost | £664.54 - £657.89 = £6.65 |

The final figure as the FX cost will be the fee taken by us for the $1,000 international trade at an exchange rate of 1.5200.

## Common Questions

### Why are there no live prices for international trades?

International orders are dealt directly through the ‘order book’ at face value. Trading this way gives access to more markets at a lower cost, but a live quoting service is not available.

### Why do I have to buy a quantity of shares for international trades?

International orders are placed directly on the relevant market's order book. You must specify a quantity to trade and cannot use an ‘invest’ option.

### Which international stock markets can I trade on?

As well as UK shares, you can trade on six global stock markets with our trading accounts. Markets have different opening times from the London Stock Exchange.

#### Opening hours of international stock markets

| Stock Exchange                         | Local Times      | UK Times        |
|----------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| New York (NYSE, NASDAQ, NYSEAmex)      | 09:30 - 16:00    | 14:30 - 21:00   |
| Frankfurt (XETRA)                      | 09:00 - 17:30    | 08:00 - 16:30   |
| Milan (Euronext)                       | 09:00 - 17:25    | 08:00 - 16:25   |
| Paris (Euronext)                       | 09:00 - 17:30    | 08:00 - 16:30   |
| Amsterdam (Euronext)                   | 09:00 - 17:30    | 08:00 - 16:30   |
| Brussels (Euronext)                    | 09:00 - 17:30    | 08:00 - 16:30   |

### What’s the difference between trading international shares and UK shares?

#### Trading International Shares

- You’re required to have an additional 10% of the total value of the trade as a buffer against possible share price fluctuations.
- No 10% buffer is needed to sell international shares, but due to the order book, you may not always be able to sell your full order.
- All international orders are placed on the order book and removed at the end of the working day. Unfulfilled or partial orders must be replaced the next day.

#### Trading UK Shares

- Automated systems request and display the best quote from all counterparties.
- No 10% buffer required; only need funds for the cost of your trade.
- The ‘invest’ option lets you use up to the full balance in your dealing account for UK shares.

## Tax and Income Questions

### What is withholding tax?

When dividends, interest payments, or some corporate settlements are made by foreign corporations or governments, Withholding Tax is usually deducted at the point of payment and paid to the government of the country initiating the payment. The amount deducted varies by country.

If you receive foreign payments, the Withholding Tax paid will appear on your consolidated tax certificate, available online or sent by post at tax year end if you’re not registered online.

### How do we treat US income on UK listed shares?

- **US listed shares paying US sourced dividends:** If you complete a W-8BEN form, you will usually pay 15% Withholding Tax instead of 30%.
- **UK listed shares paying US sourced dividends:** A 30% Withholding Tax rate is applied even if you have a W-8BEN in place.

For example, you would receive $70 on a $100 dividend.
