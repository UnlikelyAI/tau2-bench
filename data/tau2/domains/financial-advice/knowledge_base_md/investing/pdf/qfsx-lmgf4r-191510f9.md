## Fund Objective

The Fund aims to achieve capital growth by investing in a portfolio of collective investment schemes to achieve exposure to a wide range of investments, consisting of UK and Global shares and fixed interest securities, with the remainder in property assets and some exposure to absolute return strategies. We do not quote a benchmark or outperformance target for the Fund. This is because the asset allocation of the Fund will change over time. Many funds sold in the UK are grouped into sectors by the Investment Association (the trade body that represents UK investment managers) to help investors compare funds with broadly similar characteristics. Investors may wish to consider the performance of the Fund by looking at the performance of the "Mixed Investment 40-85\% Shares Sector" which as of April 2023 has a broadly similar allocation to shares, fixed interest securities and cash. The Fund may not always align with this sector and any changes will be notified via our website, accessible via the Fund Changes link below. For further information on this fund's policy and objectives, please refer to the Key Investor Information Document or the Prospectus. These documents can be accessed via the following links:

# Quarterly Fund Manager Review

Global equities achieved a mixed performance in the final quarter of 2024. US shares advanced following Donald's Trump's victory in the Presidential election, but other regional markets came under pressure amid worries over trade tariffs. In the US, shares made gains in Q4 to round out a strong year for the S\&P 500 index. Equities were supported by not only Trump's victory in the presidential election, but also the accompanying "Red Sweep" which saw the Republicans take control of Congress. Eurozone shares declined in Q4 amid fears of recession. There was political instability in France and Germany as well as worries over trade wars after Donald Trump won the US election. UK equities also fell over the quarter. The Japanese equity market experienced gains during the fourth quarter, with the TOPIX Total Return increasing by 5.4\% in yen terms. Emerging market (EM) equities and Asia ex Japan equities were both weaker in Q4 with both the MSCI EM index and MSCI AC Asia ex Japan Index ending the quarter lower amid investor concerns about the impact of Trump's proposed tariffs, particularly on China. Fixed income markets experienced considerable volatility in Q4, primarily driven by geopolitical tensions, central bank decisions, and fluctuating inflation rates. Notably, the period was marked by notable seliofts in major government bond markets, with various factors influencing investor sentiment across the globe. US Treasuries sold off in October amid concerns over potential inflationary policies arising from a possible Republican victory in the presidential election. Yields on French bonds briefly surpassed those of Greek bonds for the first time in history, driven by fears of government instability. The 10-year German Bund yield closed the year at $2.37 \%$ whilst the euro weakened against the dollar, reflecting the apprehensions in the market. In the UK, yields on 10-year gifts rose, and the pound weakened against the dollar. In real estate, occupational markets remain robust, with expected growth in most real estate sectors, particularly those driven by favourable structural trends. Tight supply conditions due to increased construction and debt finance costs, continue to support rental income levels.
