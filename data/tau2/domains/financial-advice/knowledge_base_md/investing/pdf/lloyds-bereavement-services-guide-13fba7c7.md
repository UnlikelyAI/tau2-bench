# Things to do first

There are a few things you'll need to do first:

## Get a medical certificate

This will be given to you by the hospital, GP or coroner. You'll need this to register the death.

## Get a death certificate

You need to register the death at the Register Office within a set time frame, and you'll need the medical certificate to do this. See your local council's website to find out more. It's a good idea to get a few copies.

## Find the will

This will help with what you need to do next. It may have details about the funeral and will name the executor(s).
If Lloyds Bank is the named executor call us on $\mathbf{0 8 0 0} \mathbf{0 5 6} \mathbf{0 1 7 1}$.
Lines are open Monday to Friday 9am-5pm.
Don't worry if there is no will in place - you can still get in touch.

## Paying for the funeral

We can pay this, if there's money in the account, straight to the funeral directors when you provide the bill.

## Paying other bills

Some other bills can also be paid if there is enough money available, including probate fees and Inheritance Tax, when you provide the bill.

## Other things you might need to do

- Find out what accounts or products they have
- Find out what possessions they own
- Make sure any property is secure
- Find out if you need to apply for probate

# Who we can talk to and what we'll need

Anyone can notify us of a death but in order to deal with accounts and products you will need to be:

- A personal representative of the deceased.

To help us to review any accounts and products we'll need two things:

## Death certificate

This will need to be an original copy and will be issued to you by the registrar.
We can also accept an interim death certificate or a coroner's certificate.

## Proof of identification

We'll need to identify the person dealing with the estate.
If you need to talk to us, we'll identify you by asking you some security questions.
If you're visiting the branch and you're also a customer, please bring your debit card or one form of ID with you.

If you don't have an account with us, please bring two forms of ID. At least one will need your residential address on it.

# Accounts and products - Banking and savings

## Sole account

## What happens

- The accounts will be frozen, and cards and cheque books cancelled
- If we receive money, we'll return it to the sender
- Any interest will still be paid until the account is closed


## Regular payments

- We'll stop all standing orders and direct debit payments. We can give you a list of payments from the accounts, this will help you decide if you need to set up new payments. You should contact the original company to make or cancel future payments
- Note, we can't stop subscription payments from leaving the account. You'll have to contact these companies to cancel the subscription


## Statements and letters

- We'll stop sending communications once we've been told of the death
- Some of the communications we send out are produced up to six weeks in advance. This means we can't stop these being sent
- Bereavement related communication will be sent to the personal representative or joint account holder


## Joint account

## What happens

- Accounts will be transferred to the remaining account holder(s) and stay open


## Taking money out

- The remaining account holder(s) will be able to use the account as normal. If there is a cheque book, it will be reissued in the remaining account holder's name


## Regular payments

- Standing orders and direct debits will continue and the remaining account holder can be given a list of payments to check

# Other questions you may have

## What about Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs)?

A spouse or civil partner can claim an Additional Permitted Subscription (APS) allowance on their ISA. Claiming an APS gives the spouse or civil partner an extra tax free ISA allowance to the value of the deceased's ISA. E.g. if they held $Â£ 20,000$ in their ISA this can be added on top of the spouse or civil partner's ISA allowance for the tax year. On registering the bereavement, we'll discuss this as an option.

## What about Inheritance Tax?

How much Inheritance Tax needs to be paid will depend on the value of the estate and who inherits it. See www.gov.uk/ inheritance-tax to find out more.

## What about child saving's accounts?

If the person who died is a trustee of a child's account a new trustee is needed. If the child is 16 or over, you'll need to decide if the money can be given to the child.

# Accounts and products - Mortgages

## Sole name

## What happens

- Mortgage payments will remain due. However, we don't expect you to make them for up to 18 months from the date the person died to allow you time to get probate. Please note, the amount owed will increase
- We'll cancel any direct debits paying the mortgage
- This means the mortgage will fall into arrears. We are required by the Financial Conduct Authority to write and tell you. You don't need to take any action when you get these letters


## Making payments

- If you wish to still make mortgage payments while probate is received, this can be arranged


## Mortgage options

- Once probate is in place, you have the option to pay the mortgage off


## Joint names

## What happens

- If the mortgage is held in joint names, the monthly payments will continue
- Usually the mortgage will transfer to the name of the remaining owner. Sometimes this is more complicated, if so, we'll advise you on the next steps
- If the person left on the account needs to change or discuss the monthly payments, speak to one of our Mortgage Advisers


## Making payments

- We appreciate some people find it hard to keep payments up to date, while trying to look after the estate. If payments aren't made, the account will fall into arrears and the amount owed will increase. This could affect the mortgage holder's credit rating. We'll let them know if the account is in arrears


## Mortgage options

- Once probate is in place, there will be the option to pay the mortgage off

# Probate explained

Probate is the legal process which says who can deal with the money, property and possessions of the person who has died also known as the estate.

The person who applies to legally administer the estate is often called the personal representative.

- The grant of probate is the legal document issued by the Probate Registry. We may not need to see this, it will depend on the products and services held with us
- Organisations deal with probate in different ways. You may need to get probate for organisations that are not part of Lloyds Banking Group
- To get the legal document back from the probate registry usually takes 8-16 weeks. To administer the estate can take 9-12 months. However, it can sometimes take longer
- The personal representative may also be known as:
- An executor when there's a will
- An administrator when there isn't a will
- The legal documents are known as:
- The grant of probate when there's a will
- The grant of letters of administration when there isn't a will
- Confirmation in Scotland
- To find out if a Grant is required:
