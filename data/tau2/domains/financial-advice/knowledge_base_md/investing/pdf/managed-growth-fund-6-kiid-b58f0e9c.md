# Non-UCITS retail scheme Key Investor Information

## SCOTTISH WIDOWS

This document provides you with key investor information about this fund. It is not marketing material. The information is required by law to help you understand the nature and the risks of investing in this fund. You are advised to read it so you can make an informed decision about whether to invest.

## Scottish Widows Managed Growth Fund 6 Class L Accumulation

A sub-fund of the Scottish Widows Investment Solutions Funds IGVC
The fund is managed by Scottish Widows Unit Trust Managers Limited, part of the Lloyds Banking Group.
ISIN: GB00BJRSQC32

## Objectives and investment policy

The Fund aims to achieve capital growth by investing in other funds to achieve exposure to a wide range of investments.
Between $65 \%$ and $90 \%$ of the Fund will provide exposure to shares. This may consist of UK, overseas and emerging markets shares. A maximum of $25 \%$ of the Fund will provide exposure to fixed interest securities. This may include UK and overseas, including emerging market, government bond funds, together with investment grade and high yield* corporate bond funds. A maximum of $20 \%$ of the Fund will provide exposure to property. This may include UK and overseas property funds. The Fund may also provide exposure to absolute return strategies**.
The Fund will normally be fully invested in the above asset classes, however a small part of the Fund may provide exposure to commodities. In addition, a small part of the Fund's assets may be invested (directly or indirectly) in cash and cash-like investments if it is felt this will be of benefit to the Fund. The funds may be actively or passively managed and include those managed by Scottish Widows Unit Trust Managers (SWUTM) and its associates. Active management is where the fund manager seeks to add value by making decisions on which investments to buy, sell or hold depending on, for example company, market or economic factors. Passive management is where the fund manager aims to match a benchmark and will buy, sell or hold investments depending on the components of that benchmark.
Derivatives may be used for the purpose of managing the Fund in a way that is designed to reduce risk or cost and/or generate extra income or growth (often referred to as efficient portfolio management). This includes using derivatives to make short-term changes to the currency exposures of the Fund. In addition, the funds in which the Fund invests may use techniques which are not employed by the Fund itself, for example, the use of derivatives for investment purposes, stock lending and hedging. If these funds use derivatives for investment purposes it is not intended that this would raise the risk profile of the Fund.

*Credit ratings indicate the likelihood that an issuer will be able to make their payments. Investment grade bonds have achieved or exceeded a minimum credit rating awarded by a credit rating agency. Therefore they are considered lower risk than bonds with a lower credit rating. Noninvestment grade bonds, also known as high yield bonds, have a lower credit rating than investment grade bonds, and so are considered higher risk. **Absolute return strategies aim to provide positive returns regardless of market conditions.

SWUTM does not quote a benchmark or outperformance target for the Fund. This is because the asset allocation of the Fund will change over time taking into consideration risk and SWUTM's view of the prospects of each asset class.
Investors should aim to hold their investment in the Fund for the medium to long term (at least five to ten years).
Any income received by the Fund is retained in the Fund and has the effect of increasing the share price. We calculate the value of the Fund at 12 noon daily on working days in the UK. Our dealing times are from 9am to 5pm each working day. Instructions received after 12 noon will receive the next day's price.

## Risk and reward profile

The Risk and Reward Indicator table demonstrates where the Fund ranks in terms of its potential risk and reward. The higher the rank the greater the potential reward but the greater the risk of losing money. It is based on past data, may change over time and may not be a reliable indication of the future risk profile of the Fund. The shaded area in the table below shows the Fund's ranking on the Risk and Reward Indicator.

Typically lower rewards, Topically higher rewards, lower risk

Typically higher risk

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |

The Share Class is ranked at 5 because it has experienced medium to high levels of volatility over the past 5 years.

The value of your investment and any income from it is not guaranteed and can go up and down depending on investment performance. Specific investment risks for the Fund are:

- Company shares ('equities') generally offer higher long term growth potential than some other asset classes. Values can fluctuate considerably. There's a greater risk you might not get back all of your money.

The value of a bond / fixed interest security could fall if the issuer's credit rating falls. Values are also likely to fall if interest rates rise (but increase when interest rates fall). In addition issuers might fail to make their income payments and/or repay capital.

- The use of derivatives for Efficient Portfolio Management might not achieve the described outcomes and may result in greater fluctuations of the value of the Fund, however it is not intended that this will cause the risk profile of the Fund to change.
- Property values can go up or down. Property can be hard to sell, and values could fall if properties have to be sold quickly.
- Further details of the risks relating to investment in this Fund can be found in the Prospectus which is available on request or at our website www. scottishwidows.co.uk
