The liability of the members is limited to the amount, if any, unpaid on the shares held by them.

5.4 Any reference in these Articles to the exercise of a power by the Directors shall be deemed to include a reference to the exercise of a power by any person or committee to whom it has been delegated.

6.1 Committees to which the Directors delegate any of their powers must follow procedures which are based as far as they are applicable on those provisions of the Articles which govern the taking of decisions by Directors.
6.2 The Directors may make rules of procedure for all or any committees, which prevail over rules derived from the Articles if they are not consistent with them.

# DECISION-MAKING BY DIRECTORS

## 7 Directors to take decisions collectively

7.1 The general rule about decision-making by Directors is that any decision of the Directors must be either a majority decision at a meeting or a decision taken in accordance with Article 8.
7.2 If:
(a) the Company only has one Director; and
(b) no provision of the Articles requires it to have more than one director,
the general rule in Article 7.1 does not apply, and the Director may take decisions without regard to any of the provisions of the Articles relating to Directors' decision-making.

## 8 Resolutions in Writing - Unanimous decisions

8.1 A decision of the Directors is taken in accordance with this Article when all eligible Directors indicate to each other that they share a common view on a matter.
8.2 Such a decision may take the form of:
(a) a resolution in writing, copies of which have been signed by each eligible Director or to which each eligible Director has otherwise indicated agreement in writing; or
(b) approval by email or facsimile (fax), where the director replies to an email or fax incorporating the wording of a written resolution.
8.3 Each eligible Director is not required to indicate his view on a matter in the same manner and the decision is deemed to have been taken when all eligible Directors have indicated their common view in accordance with this Article.
8.4 References in this Article to eligible Directors are to Directors who would have been entitled to vote on the matter had it been proposed as a resolution at a Directors' meeting.
8.5 A decision may not be taken in accordance with this Article if the eligible Directors would not have formed a quorum at such a meeting.

## 9 Calling a Directors' meeting

9.1 Any Director may call a Directors' meeting by giving notice of the meeting to the Directors or by authorising the Secretary to give such notice. Not less

than one business day's notice of the meeting must be given (or such lesser notice as all the Directors may agree).
9.2 Notice of any Directors' meeting must indicate:
(a) its proposed date and time;
(b) where it is to take place; and
(c) if it is anticipated that Directors participating in the meeting will not be in the same place, how it is proposed that they should communicate with each other during the meeting.
9.3 Notice of a Directors' meeting must be given to each Director, but need not be in writing. In accordance with Article 58.3 any notices sent by e-mail or fax are deemed to be received immediately.
9.4 Notice of a Directors' meeting need not be given to Directors who waive their entitlement to notice of that meeting, by giving notice to that effect to the Company before or after the date on which the meeting is held. Where such notice is given after the meeting has been held, that does not affect the validity of the meeting, or of any business conducted at it.

# 10 Participation in Directors' meetings

10.1 Subject to the Articles, Directors participate in a Directors' meeting, or part of a Directors' meeting, when:
(a) the meeting has been called and takes place in accordance with the Articles; and
(b) they can each communicate to the others any information or opinions they have on any particular item of the business of the meeting.
10.2 In determining whether Directors are participating in a Directors' meeting, it is irrelevant where any Director is or how they communicate with each other.
10.3 If all Directors participating in a meeting are not in the same place, they may decide that the meeting is to be treated as taking place wherever any of them is located.

## 11 Quorum for Directors' meetings

11.1 At a Directors' meeting, unless a quorum is participating, no proposal is to be voted on, except a proposal to call another meeting.
11.2 The quorum for Directors' meetings is two, unless there is a sole Director who may then discharge all the functions of the Directors.
11.3 For the purposes of any meeting (or part of a meeting) held pursuant to Article 17 to authorise a Director's conflict of interest, if there is only one eligible Director in office other than the conflicted Director(s), the quorum for such meeting (or part of a meeting) shall be one eligible Director.

## 12 Chairing Directors' meetings

12.1 The Directors may appoint a Director to chair their meetings.
12.2 The person so appointed for the time being is known as the Chairman.

12.3 The Directors may terminate the Chairman's appointment at any time.
12.4 If the Chairman is not participating in a Directors' meeting within ten minutes of the time at which it was to start, the participating Directors must appoint one of themselves to chair it.

# 13 Casting Vote

If the numbers of votes for and against a proposal are equal, the Chairman or other Director chairing the meeting has a casting vote.

## 14 Validity of proceedings

All acts done by any meeting of Directors, or of any committee or subcommittee of the Directors, or by any person acting as a member of any such committee or sub-committee, shall as regards all persons dealing in good faith with the Company be valid, notwithstanding that there was some defect in the appointment of any Director or any such persons, or that any such persons were disqualified or had vacated office, or were not entitled to vote.

## 15 Records of decisions to be kept

The Directors must ensure that the Company keeps a record, in writing, for at least 10 years from the date of the decision recorded, of every unanimous or majority decision taken by the Directors.

## 16 Directors' discretion to make further rules

Subject to the Articles, the Directors may make any rule which they think fit about how they take decisions, and about how such rules are to be recorded or communicated to Directors.

## CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

## 17 Authorisation of Directors' interests

17.1 For the purposes of section 175 of the Act, the Directors shall have the power to authorise any matter which would or might otherwise constitute or give rise to a breach of the duty of a Director so as to avoid a situation in which he or she has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the interests of the Company.
17.2 Authorisation of a matter under this Article 17 shall be effective only if:
(a) the matter in question shall have been proposed for consideration at a meeting of the Directors, in accordance with the usual procedures for such meetings or in such other manner as the Directors may resolve;
(b) any requirement as to the quorum at the meeting of the Directors at which the matter is considered is met without counting the Director in question and any other interested Director (together the "Interested Directors"); and
(c) the matter was agreed to without the Interested Directors voting or would have been agreed to if the votes of the Interested Directors had not been counted.
17.3 Any authorisation of a matter under this Article may:

(a) extend to any actual or potential conflict of interest which may arise out of the matter so authorised;
(b) be subject to such conditions or limitations as the Directors may resolve, whether at the time such authorisation is given or subsequently; and
(c) be terminated by the Directors at any time,
and the Director(s) in question shall comply with any obligations imposed on him/them by the Directors pursuant to any such authorisation.
17.4 A Director shall not, save as otherwise agreed by him, be accountable to the Company for any benefit which he (or a person connected with him) derives from any matter authorised by the Directors under this Article and any contract, transaction or arrangement relating to such a matter shall not be liable to be avoided on the grounds of any such benefit.

# 18 Permitted Interests

18.1 Subject to compliance with Article 18.3, a Director, notwithstanding his office, may have an interest of the following kind:
(a) where a Director (or a person connected with him) is a director or other officer of, or employed by, or otherwise interested (including by the holding of shares) in any Lloyds Banking Group company;
(b) where a Director (or a person connected with him) is a party to, or otherwise interested in, any contract, transaction or arrangement with a Lloyds Banking Group company, or in which the Company is otherwise interested;
(c) where a Director has an interest which cannot reasonably be regarded as likely to give rise to a conflict of interest;
(d) where a Director has an interest, or a transaction or arrangement gives rise to an interest, of which the Director is not aware; or
(e) where a Director has any other interest authorised by ordinary resolution.
18.2 No authorisation shall be necessary in respect of any interest permitted by Article 18.1.
18.3 A Director shall declare the nature and extent of any interest permitted under Article 18.1 and not falling within Article 18.4, at a meeting of the Directors or in such other manner as the Directors may resolve.
18.4 No declaration of an interest shall be required by a Director in relation to an interest:
(a) falling within Article 18.1(a), 18.1(c) or 18.1(d);
(b) if, or to the extent that, the other Directors are already aware of such interest (and for this purpose the other Directors are treated as aware of anything of which they ought reasonably to be aware); or
(c) if, or to the extent that, it concerns the terms of his service contract (as defined in section 227 of the Act) that have been or are to be

considered by a meeting of the Directors, or by a committee of Directors appointed for the purpose under these Articles.
18.5 A Director shall not, save as otherwise agreed by him, be accountable to the Company for any benefit which he (or a person connected with him) derives from any such contract, transaction or arrangement or from any such office or employment or from any interest in any Lloyds Banking Group company or for such remuneration, each as referred to in Article 18.1, and no such contract, transaction or arrangement shall be liable to be avoided on the grounds of any such interest or benefit.

# 19 Transactional conflicts

19.1 A Director shall not be entitled to vote on any resolution in respect of any contract, transaction or arrangement, or any other proposal, in which he (or a person connected with him) has an interest, unless the interest is solely of a kind permitted by Article 18.1.
19.2 A Director shall not be counted in the quorum at a meeting of the Directors in relation to any resolution on which he is not entitled to vote.

## 20 Confidential information

20.1 Subject to Article 20.2, if a Director, otherwise than by virtue of his position as Director, receives information in respect of which he owes a duty of confidentiality to a person other than the Company, he shall not be required:
(a) to disclose such information to the Company, to the Directors, or to any officer or employee of the Company; or
(b) to use or apply such confidential information for the purpose of or in connection with the performance of his duties as a Director.
20.2 Where such duty of confidentiality arises out of a situation in which the Director has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the interests of the Company, Article 20.1 shall apply only if the conflict arises out of a matter which has been authorised under Article 17 or falls within Article 18.
20.3 This Article 20 is without prejudice to any equitable principle or rule of law which may excuse or release the Director from disclosing information, in circumstances where disclosure may otherwise be required under this Article 20.

## 21 Directors' interests - general

21.1 For the purposes of Articles 17 to 21 (inclusive):
(a) a person is connected with a Director if that person is connected for the purposes of section 252 of the Act; and
(b) an interest (whether of the Director or of a person connected with such Director) of which a Director has no knowledge and of which it is unreasonable to expect him to have knowledge shall not be treated as an interest of his.
21.2 Where a Director has an interest which can reasonably be regarded as likely to give rise to a conflict of interest, the Director may, and shall if so

requested by the Directors, take such additional steps as may be necessary or desirable for the purpose of managing such conflict of interest, including compliance with any procedures laid down from time to time by the Directors for the purpose of managing conflicts of interest generally and/or any specific procedures approved by the Directors for the purpose of or in connection with the situation or matter in question, including without limitation:

(b) not reviewing documents or information made available to the Directors generally in relation to such situation or matter and/or arranging for such documents or information to be reviewed by a professional adviser to ascertain the extent to which it might be appropriate for him to have access to such documents or information.
21.3 The Company may by ordinary resolution ratify any contract, transaction or arrangement, or other proposal, not properly authorised by reason of a contravention of any provisions of Articles 17 to 21 (inclusive).
21.4 If a question arises at a meeting of Directors or of a committee of Directors as to the right of a Director to participate in the meeting (or part of the meeting) for voting or quorum purposes, the question may, before the conclusion of the meeting, be referred to the Chairman whose ruling in relation to any Director other than the Chairman is to be final and conclusive.
21.5 If any question as to the right to participate in the meeting (or part of the meeting) should arise in respect of the Chairman, the question is to be decided by a decision of the Directors at that meeting, for which purpose the Chairman is not to be counted as participating in the meeting (or that part of the meeting) for voting or quorum purposes.

(iv) are not deemed to be agents of or for their appointors.

(i) may be counted for the purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at a Directors' meeting (but only if that person's appointor is not present); and
(ii) may participate in a decision taken by the Directors under Article 7 and/or Article 8 (but only if that person's appointor is not participating).
(d) If two or more appointors appoint the same person as an Alternate Director or, alternatively, if an Alternate Director is himself a Director or shall attend any such meeting as an Alternate Director for more than one Director, his voting rights shall be cumulative but he shall not be counted more than once for the purposes of the quorum.
(e) A Director who is also an Alternate Director has one vote at a Directors' meeting for each of his appointors who is absent from the meeting in addition to his own vote.
(f) An Alternate Director is not entitled to receive any remuneration from the Company for serving as an Alternate Director except such part of the remuneration payable to that Alternate Director's appointor as the appointor may direct by notice in writing made to the Company.
(g) An Alternate Director shall be entitled to contract and be interested in and benefit from contracts or arrangements or transactions and to be repaid expenses and to be indemnified to the same extent as if he were a Director.

The Company shall have a Secretary who shall be appointed on such terms as the Directors think fit.

# PART 4 SHARES AND DISTRIBUTIONS

## SHARES

## 28 Issue of shares

Shares may be issued as nil, partly paid or fully paid.

## 29 Pre-emption rights

The Directors may allot equity securities as if section 561 of the Act (Existing shareholders' rights of pre-emption) did not apply to the allotment.

## 30 Lien over shares

30.1 The Company shall have a full and first and paramount lien over every share (not being a fully paid share) for all moneys (whether presently payable or not) payable at a fixed time or called in respect of that share. The Directors may at any time declare any share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provision of this Article. The Company's lien on a share shall extend of any amount payable in respect of it.
30.2 The Company may sell in such manner as the Directors determine any shares on which the Company has a lien if a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable and is not paid within fourteen clear days after notice has been given to the holder of the share or to the person entitled to it in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of the holder, demanding payment and stating that if the notice is not complied with the shares may be sold.
30.3 To give effect to a sale the Directors may authorise any person to execute an instrument of transfer of the shares sold to, or in accordance with the directions of, the purchaser. The title of the transferee to the shares shall not be affected by any irregularity in or invalidity of the proceedings in reference to the sale.
30.4 The net proceeds after the sale, after payment of the costs, shall be applied in payment of so much of the sum for which the lien exists as is presently payable, and any residue shall (upon surrender to the Company for cancellation of the certificate for the shares sold or upon the grant of a suitable indemnity for any lost certificates and subject to a like lien for any moneys not presently payable as existed upon the shares before the sale) be paid to the person entitled to the shares at the date of the sale.

## 31 Calls on shares and forfeiture

31.1 Subject to the terms of allotment, the Directors may make calls upon the shareholders in respect of any moneys unpaid on their shares (whether nominal value or premium) and each shareholder shall (having received at least 14 days clear notice, specifying when and where payment should be made) pay to the Company as required by the notice the amount called on his shares. A call may require payments by instalments. A call may, before the receipt of any sum due, be revoked or postponed in whole or in part. A person on whom a call is made shall remain liable for calls made on him notwithstanding the subsequent transfer of the shares upon which the call was made.

31.2 The call shall be deemed to have been made at the time the Directors pass a resolution authorising the call.
