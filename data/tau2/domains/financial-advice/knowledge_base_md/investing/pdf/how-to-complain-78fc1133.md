# HOW TO COMPLAIN

## Direct Investments

## How to tell us about a problem

If you want to make a complaint, it's best to talk to a member of staff first, as this will be the quickest way for us to take action:

Call our Customer Service Team on 03456060560 or +441132797518 if calling from abroad, Monday to Friday, 8.00am-9.00pm.

## $\rightarrow$ -

Email us using the online form in the Contact Us section on our website or chat directly to one of our team via our live chat facility once you're logged into your account at lloydsbank.com/investing

Write to us at the following address:
Customer Relations
Lloyds Bank Direct Investments
Lovell Park Road
Leeds LS1 1NS

## We take complaints seriously

We take all complaints seriously. Many issues can be dealt with immediately, but some do take a little time to investigate thoroughly. If this happens, we will get a specialist from our Customer Relations team to resolve the issue. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) gives us eight weeks to resolve complaints - we will aim to get your complaint resolved well before this deadline.

# If we can't find a solution together

If you're still not happy and we can't put things right to your satisfaction, you can ask the Financial Ombudsman Service to look at your complaint - provided you have tried to resolve the matter directly with us first. We hope you won't need to contact the Financial Ombudsman Service but if you do, they can be contacted at:

Financial Ombudsman Service
Exchange Tower
London E14 9SR
Tel: 08000234567 or 03001239123
Email: complaint.info@
financial-ombudsman.org.uk
For more information, visit:
www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk
Please bear in mind that the Financial
Ombudsman will only help if you've already referred a complaint to us and you're still not happy.

You may also be able to take civil action should you remain unhappy following a final decision on your complaint.

## Our promise

We're committed to giving our customers a high standard of service, but we also know that occasionally we don't get it right. We will do our very best to resolve it immediately. But, where we can't sort things out to your satisfaction straightaway, we'll make sure you have the name and contact details of the person or team dealing with your complaint.
