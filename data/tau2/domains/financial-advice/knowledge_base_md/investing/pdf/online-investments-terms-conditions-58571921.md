4.1 You can use the service to make deals in certain types of investments. You can do this by placing orders to deal through our online service (or if the online service is not available and in the case of sale transactions, by using the telephone service).
4.2 Once we have accepted your application, we will open an account for you. Your account will hold the assets (that is, your investments and client money in relation to which we provide the service).
4.3 For the purposes of the regulatory requirements, we will treat you as a retail client in relation to this agreement. Categorisation as a retail client affords you the highest degree of consumer protection under the regulatory requirements. However, this does not necessarily mean that you will automatically be eligible to bring a claim under either any investor compensation scheme or the FOS.

## Execution only service

4.4 The service is an execution only service. This means that we will execute your orders in accordance with the agreement, and we will not provide you with investment advice or discretionary management in relation to your assets. Any investment decisions will be your own. We are not required to assess the appropriateness or suitability of our service for you and the protection accorded by the FCA Rules on assessing appropriateness or suitability does not apply to this service.
4.5 If you are in any doubt about using the service and making your own investment decisions we recommend that you seek advice from a suitably qualified financial adviser.
4.6 We will not provide you with legal, tax or other advice in connection with your account.

## Investment risks

4.7 There are risks involved in the use of the service, including investment risk caused by the fact that the value of your investments will change over time. You should read 'Understanding Risk' which you will find at lloydsbank.com/investing/ understanding-investing/riskexplained and 'How Safe Are My Assets' which you will find at lloydsbank.com/investing/help-and-guidance/ important-information under the "Financial Services Compensation Scheme" section. The value of your investments and the level of any income from them can go down as well as up. You may not get back the full amount you have invested.

You should also remember that past performance of investments is not an indication of how those investments might perform in the future.
4.8 Before purchasing investments you should read the relevant Key Investor Information Document that will be provided to you in relation to the relevant fund. This sets out important details in relation to the fund, including its investment aims and the risks associated with investing in that fund.
4.9 We will provide you with additional risk warnings which are relevant to the service, and it is important that you read these and have understood them before you invest. You can access these risk warnings at lloydsbank.com/ investments. If you are unsure about what the risks of the service are or what they might mean for you, you should contact a suitably qualified financial adviser.

## Cancellation

4.10 You have the right to cancel the agreement within 30 days of us confirming to you that we have opened your account and that it is available for you to use, or of us providing you with the relevant terms, whichever is the later. This is known as the 'cancellation period'. You also have the right to cancel a transfer of an ISA from another ISA manager within 30 days of the transfer.
4.11 If you wish to cancel, you must contact us within 30 days. You will have no further obligations in relation to the service and you will not be charged any fee for cancelling. However, you agree that we may start providing the service to you before the end of the cancellation period, in which case we may make a pro-rata charge for the service provided to you up to cancellation.
4.12 If you cancel, we will sell the investments in your account and send you the sales proceeds after the settlement date. The cash that you receive may be less than you transferred to us if we have carried out deals on your behalf or if the value of your investments has fallen during the cancellation period, and you will bear that market risk. You will also bear any costs associated with deals which we have carried out for you.
4.13 If you have transferred funds to us during the cancellation period, we will not be able to return these to you until you provide us with instructions as to how you want us to transfer them to you
or to another provider. This does not affect your right to cancel this agreement, but there may be a delay in returning your funds if we do not receive your instructions with your cancellation notice. If the value of your investments falls during that period, you will bear that market risk.
4.14 If you do not exercise the right to cancel, the agreement will remain in effect until terminated under its terms.

## 7. Funding and withdrawing amounts from your account

## Funding your account

7.1 When you place an order to purchase investments, we will only carry out that order where you have sufficient tradable funds in your account. Those tradable funds will be used to purchase investments and to pay any associated costs and charges. Provided that we receive tradable funds by 8 am on a working day, we will place the deal with the fund provider no later than the end of the following working day.
7.2 When you place an order to buy investments, we will take one of the following steps to fund your account:

- we will debit your nominated bank accountusing your debit card details. We will treat your order to deal as an instruction to debit the relevant amount. Provided that we receive an 'authorisation' from your bank - we will deem this to be tradable funds immediately; or
- where you ask us to do so and in respect of your initial investment only, we will request a money transfer from a Lloyds bank account in your name. We will initiate the request as soon as we have your instructions although the money will only become tradable funds once we have received it.

73 If you are going to make a payment by debit card and your bank imposes any limits on your debit card, it is your responsibility to notify your bank of the payment that we will request so that we can collect it.

74 It is your responsibility to ensure that there is enough money in your nominated bank account to fund your account and pay any applicable costs and charges. Where you instruct us to take money from your nominated bank account using your debit card, it is your responsibility to ensure that you provide us with correct and up-to-date debit card details. We will not be liable for any loss arising directly or indirectly from the late collection of a payment that is outside our reasonable control, including any loss of investment opportunity or loss of tax relief.

## Income

75 All sale proceeds received by us will be paid promptly into your account.

76 Units are accumulation units which means that the fund provider will use income it receives in respect of units to buy further units in the fund.

77 Any cash that you are entitled to receive in connection with your account will be rounded down to the nearest penny.

## Withdrawing amounts from your account

78 You may, at any time, make a 'Sell to Withdraw' instruction in respect of some or all of your investments. If you do so, we will liquidate those investments and effect the transfer of the sale proceeds to your nominated bank account on the settlement date specified in the trade confirmation.

79 A 'Sell to Withdraw' instruction can only be placed using our online service or, if the online service is not available, using our telephone service.
7.10 Funds will be usually sent by electronic transfer to your nominated bank account which can take up to seven working days. However, please note we may need to validate your nominated bank account details before we can pay you. This may lead to a delay in you receiving the funds. Alternatively, if your account is an ISA we can transfer cash to another ISA manager (see Condition 19.23).
7.11 If we are unable to complete the transfer of funds to your nominated bank account and the value of the funds is equal to or above $£ 25$ we will make payment by cheque payable to you. If the value is less than $£ 25$ we will hold the sum in your account.

## 8. Dealing

## Placing orders

8.1 Except as otherwise set out in this agreement, you can place orders to deal:
a. using the online service at any time when it is available; or
b. where the online service is unavailable, using the telephone service during the stated business hours for the telephone service.

If the online service is unavailable or if you receive an error message, you should use the telephone service to place or confirm a 'Sell to Withdraw' order or confirm if an order has been successfully placed.
8.2 When you place an order to purchase investments, you must tell us the exact name and monetary value of investments, that you wish to purchase, and any other information that we may reasonably require. When you place an order to sell investments, you must tell us the exact name and number of investments that you wish to sell, and any other information that we may reasonably require.
8.3 We can change the investments available for purchase at any time in accordance with Condition 16. Where we remove an investment you can continue to hold existing investments of that type, but you will not be able to purchase those investments.

## Accepting or refusing orders

8.4 Where we have accepted your order we will confirm this by giving you an order or bargain reference. Your order will not bind us until we have accepted it.

8.5 Any deal that we accept in good faith will form a legally binding contract between you and us. Once we have accepted your order you cannot change your mind afterwards, except as described at Condition 18.4 in relation to regular monthly investments.
8.6 Once we have accepted an order we may, at our discretion, delay execution of that order until we can contact you to clarify or check your order, if we reasonably believe that it is in your interests to do so. We will not be liable for any actual or potential financial loss or expense that you incur as a result of a delay, provided that we have taken all reasonable steps to contact you promptly.
8.7 We may reject your order where:
a. your account does not contain sufficient tradable funds for the relevant deal or any other orders to purchase investments that you have placed but that have not yet settled. If tradable funds are insufficient at the point of execution to cover the whole amount of the deal, we may not carry out any part of the deal.
b. your account does not contain sufficient investments for the relevant deal and for any other orders to sell investments that you have placed but that have not yet settled.
c. by carrying out your order, we reasonably believe that we might breach regulatory requirements or the rules of any market or become exposed to action or censure from any government, regulator or law enforcement agency;
d. we are not reasonably satisfied that you have the right to deal in investments in relation to which you have given us an order, in which case we may not accept your order until you have provided us with proof that is reasonably satisfactory to us;
e. your order is unclear or we have reasonable grounds to believe that it is incorrect, given in error or is not given by you or a person authorised by you; or
f. we have not received any information that we have requested and which is reasonably necessary for us to carry out the deal;
g. your order is to sell investments and you owe us any money.
8.8 If we reject an order we will take reasonable steps to tell you about that rejected order and the reason for our rejection, provided that we are permitted to do so under the regulatory requirements.

## Executing orders

8.9 If you place an order on a working day, we will place the deal with the fund provider as soon as reasonably practicable. If you place an order on any other day, we will place the deal with the fund provider as soon as reasonably practicable after the start of the next working day. Orders will be placed by us within two working days of us receiving tradable funds.
8.10 Once we have accepted your order we cannot accept any responsibility for any actual or potential financial loss or expense that you incur if, for any reason (other than our negligence), there is a delay or change in market conditions before the execution of your order is complete.
8.11 If we negligently fail to carry out an order that we have accepted, we will take all reasonable steps to return you to the position that you should have been in had we not so failed.
8.12 We will execute each order in accordance with the regulatory requirements and the rules of any market on which the deal is effected.
8.13 We carry out orders in accordance with 'best execution'. 'Best execution' is our obligation under the regulatory requirements to take all sufficient steps to obtain, when executing orders, the best possible results for our clients on a consistent basis in accordance with our Order Execution Policy (OEP).
8.14 We will carry out your orders in accordance with our OEP which sets out the arrangements that we have put in place to ensure that we meet our 'best execution' obligations. Our current OEP has been provided to you, and we will provide you with any updated OEP from time to time, including by publishing this on our website at lloydsbank.com
8.15 We may treat each order in more than one type of investment or each order to deal at different times in the same type of investment as separate orders.
8.16 If after an order is placed on your behalf and we are asked by the fund provider to cancel any dealings in the relevant investment we will not be liable for any actual or potential financial loss you incur as a result.

## Trade confirmations

8.17 We will send you a trade confirmation for each deal no later than the working day following that on which we carried out your order or, where that order was carried out by a third party on our behalf, no later than the working day after that on which we receive the relevant confirmation from that third party.
8.18 You can ask us at any time for an update on the status of any order you have placed.
8.19 Subject to 14.9 , our deal records are conclusive. This means that, in the absence of any obvious error, the information held on our computer systems, and the trade confirmation for that deal, are the only valid evidence of the deal. In particular, a screen message you receive as part of the online service may not be used as evidence of a deal.
8.20 If you become aware or believe that information in a trade confirmation or on our systems is incomplete or incorrect, you must tell us as soon as possible so that we can rectify any missing or incomplete information.

## Switches

8.21 You may give us an order to sell investments and automatically reinvest the proceeds in one or more other investments. This is called a 'switch'.
8.22 You can switch from one investment to one or more other investments. Once we have accepted your order, your investments will be sold and new investments purchased. The purchase of the investments is conditional on the fund provider carrying out the relevant transactions and the entire process could take up to 10 working days to complete.
8.23 The ongoing charge for the investments you switch into might be different to those for the investment from which you are switching. For further details, please refer to the relevant Key Investor Information Document.
8.24 You will receive a confirmation email about your switch transaction(s) and you will also receive individual trade confirmations for both sale(s) and purchase(s).
8.25 A switch of investments within the Investment Account is regarded as disposal for Capital Gains Tax purposes. Under current law, a switch between eligible investments within an ISA is not subject to Capital Gains Tax.
8.26 You can only make a switch within the same account. If you want to sell investments from one
account and buy investments in another, you will have to give us separate instructions to do this.

## 9. Settlement

9.1 Your account will be denominated in Pounds Sterling. We will carry out deals and settle them with and for you in Pounds Sterling.
9.2 Where we carry out a deal for you, so long as you have complied with your obligations, your account will reflect the cash proceeds and/or price and the investments relating to that deal, as follows:
a. where you buy investments:
i. the investments and the price paid for those investments will be shown on your account up to two working days after the dealing date and you will be able to deal with them from that point; and
ii. the purchase price will be debited from your account on the dealing date and will cease to be tradable funds from the dealing date;
b. where you sell investments:
i. the investments will be debited from your account on the dealing date; and
ii. the cash proceeds will be credited to your account as tradable funds up to two working days after the dealing date but will only become available funds for you to withdraw on the settlement date.

## Receipt of proceeds on the sale of investments

9.3 If you sell investments the net sale proceeds will become tradable funds up to two working days after the dealing date but will not become available funds until the settlement date. Once the sale proceeds become available funds we will pay them to your nominated bank account unless you have sold the investments as part of a switch, in which case some or all of the sale proceeds will be used for that switch.
9.4 If you owe us any amounts, we may use sale proceeds to meet such outstanding amounts.

## Payment on the purchase of investments

9.5 When you use your account to purchase investments (including regular monthly investments) the price for those investments will be deducted from your nominated bank account and placed into your account. Within 48 hours, the price will be deducted from your

account and will cease to be tradable funds on the dealing date.
9.6 Once you have placed an order for a deal the relevant amount in your account required to settle that deal will be committed to that deal and will not be tradable funds that you can use for any other deal.

## Investments

9.7 When we carry out a deal for you we will accept or deliver the relevant investments as applicable on the settlement date.
9.8 If a corporate action results in investments being due to or from you, your account will be updated in line with the terms of such corporate action, as notified to you at the time.

## Your failure to settle

9.9 If you fail to:
a. pay amounts due from you in settlement;
b. pay, when due, a charge notified to you in accordance with this agreement or any other amount properly due to us under this agreement; and/or
c. make investments available in your account in order to complete a deal;
we may:
d. treat any outstanding deal as having been cancelled;
e. apply all relevant costs and charges for carrying out that deal;
f. require you to reimburse us for the cost of buying in investments in order to settle a deal, together with any associated costs and fees which we incur;
g. claim from you the total amount that you owe us together with interest on that amount at a rate of $2 \%$ above the Lloyds Variable Mortgage Base Rate from time to time in force (calculated on a daily basis) from that date until payment in full has been received; and/or
h. to the extent permitted by regulatory requirements, retain, transfer or sell any of your investments or connected rights that our nominee company holds for you and any available funds, and apply the proceeds towards settling the total amount owed by you. Any shortfall will still be due from you.
9.10 We reserve the right to pass your details on to
a third party for debt collection purposes if we reasonably believe that any amount owing to us by you will not be paid.

## Our failure to settle

9.11 There may be circumstances that occur in relation to a deal, other than your failure to make tradable funds or investments available for settlement, and which mean that we are not able to settle your deal on the settlement date, or at all.
9.12 Where this happens, we will:
a. where your deal is a sale of investments, debit the investments from your account up to two working days after the dealing date and give you the sale proceeds as available funds from the settlement date, regardless of whether the deal has actually settled; or
b. where your deal is a purchase of investments debit the purchase price from your account on the dealing date and show the investments as if they are credited to your account on the dealing date, regardless of whether the deal has actually settled. However, until the deal actually settles, we will not actually hold the investments for you but will instead hold an amount of client money which is equivalent to the purchase price or, if higher, the market value of those investments. This means that, if we were to become insolvent before settlement occurred, you may have the right to claim that amount of client money, rather than actual investments.

## 10. Holding investments and cash in your account

## Holding your investments

10.1 Investments in your account will be held for you in 'safe custody'. This means that they will be kept separate from our own investments and we will register ownership of your investments in the name of a nominee company (which may or may not be controlled by us). The nominee company will have legal title to the investments and you will retain beneficial ownership at all times.
10.2 You agree your investments will be pooled with investments held by the nominee company or sub-custodian for other clients. This means that your investments will not be separately identified from those of other clients.

Regardless of the controls and measures in place there can be instances when shortfalls in money or investments can occur, sometimes just during the working day or sometimes for a longer

period. If there is a shortfall in any of the holdings of the nominee company or sub-custodian you may share proportionally in such losses.

Where we identify a discrepancy that results from or reveals a shortfall, or during an investigation where we deem it appropriate to do so, we will allocate a sufficient amount of our own money to cover the value of the shortfall, which we will hold as client money.
10.3 For CREST eligible UK investments, some companies offer special benefits to their shareholders (that is, 'shareholder perks'). As your investments will be pooled with those of other clients and will be registered in the name of the nominee company or a sub-custodian, we may not be able to claim shareholder perks for you. However, if we can claim shareholder perks for you and you ask us to do so, we will do this and pass them on to you. In some cases we may need to send you proof of your holding to claim your shareholder perks directly from the company.
10.4 We will hold your investments in accordance with regulatory requirements.
10.5 We will accept full responsibility for the acts and omissions of our nominee companies as if they were our own.
10.6 Where we appoint a third party to act as subcustodian, we will exercise all due skill, care and diligence in the selection and appointment of that third party. However, we accept no responsibility for the default or other failure to perform by a third party sub-custodian except to the extent that we have failed to exercise such due skill, care and diligence.
10.7 Where your investments are held by the nominee company or a third party custodian, we cannot ensure that you would not lose any investments if the entity fails. In order to show that your investments are not available to that entity's creditors, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that their records show that the investments are held for you and that they do not belong to us - the nominee company - or the third party sub-custodian. In the event that a nominee third party custodian becomes insolvent we will seek to recover your investments through all means reasonably available to us, including from the administrator or insolvency practitioner appointed to deal with that entity's affairs. During such periods you may not be able to place order to deal in the affected investments.
10.8 You authorise us and the nominee companies and third party sub-custodians which we appoint
to hold or transfer investments (or entitlements to them) to securities depositaries, clearing or settlement systems, account controllers or other participants in the relevant systems in the course of providing the service. These investments or entitlements will be separately identifiable from any investments or entitlements held in the same system for our account. These entities may be located in or outside the UK.
10.9 We will not lend or deposit by way of collateral any investments in your account to a third party.
10.10 You must not use the investments and cash in your account as security for a loan.
10.11 Where permitted by regulatory requirements, if we have not received instructions in relation to your account for at least 12 years and we have taken reasonable steps to contact you but if we cannot do so, we may sell your investments and pay the proceeds and/or transfer your investments to a charity of our choice. Where we do this we will and Lloyds Bank will unconditionally undertake to pay you a sum equal to the value of the investments at the time they were sold or transferred to that charity if you later contact us to claim your investments.
10.12 You agree that we may, in accordance with the regulatory requirements, not treat investments as client assets where we receive them from you in relation to a delivery versus payment transaction to sell those investments which is settled through a commercial settlement system. We will treat the relevant investments as our own property and not as client assets for the shortest of:
a. the period of time between when we deduct the relevant investments from your account and when the deal settles; and
b. 3 working days from when we deduct the relevant investments from your account.
Cash proceeds in respect of the sale will be held as client money for you from the settlement date specified in the trade confirmation.
10.13 We carry out regular reconciliations and record checks to make sure that we, and relevant third parties, are holding the correct investments for you and our other clients. It is possible that a reconciliation or record check may reveal a discrepancy (for instance a difference in our records when compared against a third party's records) in relation to your investments. This could suggest that we might not be holding enough investments for you (a 'shortfall'). If this

happens, we will place equivalent investments or money of our own, into an account to cover that shortfall, until the discrepancy is resolved. Those investments or money will be segregated from our own investments and money and will be held as client assets or client money.

## Holding your cash as client money

10.14 Where we hold cash in your account pending investment, settlement or payment to your nominated bank account, we will hold it as client money in accordance with the client money rules.
10.15 This means that we will keep money that we hold for you separate from our own money. Your money will be placed, along with money belonging to other clients, in a pooled client money bank account with an approved bank in accordance with the client money rules.
10.16 As your client money will be pooled with client money held for other clients, your client money will not be separately identified from that of other clients and if there is a shortfall in the amount held by the approved bank you may share proportionally in such losses. We may also place client money in notice or unbreakable term deposit accounts. Client money may be placed in accounts with notice periods of, or on deposit for fixed terms of, up to 95 days. Placing client money in notice or term deposit accounts does not in itself affect your ability to deal with or withdraw funds from your Accounts. However, such amounts may not be immediately available for distribution to you in the event of default by us or by one of the institutions with whom your money is held. In the event that an approved bank becomes insolvent we will seek to recover your money through all means reasonably available to us, including from the administrator or insolvency practitioner appointed to deal with that entity's affairs.
10.17 We will exercise all due skill, care and diligence in the selection, appointment and periodic review of any approved bank to whom we transfer client money.
10.18 You authorise us to allow another person, such as an exchange, clearing house or intermediate broker, to hold or control your client money for the purposes of deals for you through or with that other person.
10.19 We may place your client money with an approved bank outside the UK and where we effect a deal on your behalf, or income is paid on investments outside the UK. Your client money might have to pass through a third party such as an exchange, clearing house or intermediate broker located outside the UK. In these circumstances the applicable legal and regulatory regime will be different from that in the UK and if that person fails, and is thereby unable to repay all of its creditors, your client money may be treated differently than if it were held in the UK. In the event of such a person being declared in default we will make a claim on your behalf, including, where applicable, through any available compensation scheme.
10.20 We do not currently pay interest on client monies held in your account.
a. Any interest we retain helps to develop our products \& services
b. There is no requirement to hold a minimum balance - You should make sure that there is enough cash held to cover charges, when they are due
10.21 Where permitted by the regulatory requirements, if there has been no movement in the balance of the client money in your account for a period of at least six years and we have taken reasonable steps to contact you but cannot do so, we may cease to hold these amounts as client money and pay them to a charity of our choice. Where we do this we will unconditionally undertake to pay you a sum equal to that paid to charity if you later contact us to claim these amounts.
10.22 You agree that we may, in accordance with the client money rules, not treat money as client money in respect of a delivery versus payment transaction to buy investments settled though a commercial settlement system. We will treat the relevant funds as our own money and not as client money for the shortest of:
a. the period of time between when we deduct tradable funds from your account and when the deal settles; and
b. 3 working days from when we deduct tradable funds from your account.

When we receive the investments you have purchased, we will hold them as client assets for you.

## Transfers of business

10.23 If we transfer to a third party the business to which this agreement and your client money and/or investments relate, you agree that we may transfer your client money and/or investments to that third party as part of the transfer of business, provided that:
a. the client money and/or investments are

transferred on terms which require the third party to whom they are transferred to return your client money and/or investments to you as soon as practicable at your request; and
b. if the amount of client money and/or investments transferred is not less than $£ 25$, either:
i. the client money and investments transferred will be held in accordance with the client money rules and the UK regulatory requirements relating to the holding of investments; or
ii. we have exercised due skill and care in the selection of the third party to whom your client money and/or investments are transferred.
10.24 If we transfer your client money and/or investments under Condition 10.23, we will give you notice no later than seven days after the transfer, informing you:
a. whether or not the client money and/ or investments will be held by the person to whom they have been transferred in accordance with the client money rules and the UK regulatory requirements applying to the holding of investments and, if not, how the client money and/or investments being transferred will be held by that person;
b. the extent to which the client money and/ or investments transferred will be protected under a compensation scheme; and
c. that you may opt to have your transferred client money and/or investments returned to you as soon as practicable at your request.

## 11. Our right to use your assets

11.1 If we, or another member of the Lloyds Banking Group, reasonably believe that you will be unable to make payments when due, we or they may, where regulatory requirements allow, retain, transfer or sell any of your assets so far as is reasonably necessary:
a. to settle any transactions entered into on your behalf; or
b. to pay any of your outstanding liabilities, arising under the agreement or any other arrangement you have with us or them.

## Our rights of 'set off'

11.2 If:
a. we owe you money, including on a current, savings or other account under this agreement or another agreement with us; and
b. you have failed to pay us any amount that you owe us under any agreement that you have with us,
we may, where regulatory requirements allow, use the money that we owe you to reduce or repay the amount you owe us. This is called a 'set off right'.
11.3 We may use our set off right even if the amount you owe us is dependent on another event or has not yet become due, if we reasonably think that you will be unable to pay us when the amount does become due.
11.4 We may use our set off right without telling you in advance if we reasonably think that you will do something to prevent us from obtaining repayment by set off, or if we have otherwise agreed with you that we can do so.
11.5 If you have told us, in a way reasonably acceptable to us, that money that you hold in an account in your name is not yours, but someone else's, we will not use the set off right that we have under the agreement against the money in that account.
11.6 We may use our set off right where you have accounts which are only in your name, as well as joint accounts.
11.7 We may also set off amounts that we owe you against amounts that you owe other companies in the Lloyds Banking Group and set off amounts other companies in the Lloyds Banking Group owe you against amounts you owe us, unless prevented by insolvency law.

## Our security interest over your investments

11.8 As long as you owe us any money under this agreement or any other agreement with us, we may retain possession of your investments as security (this right is known as a 'lien').

## General

11.9 Other members of the Lloyds Banking Group may, where regulatory requirements allow, enforce these rights of set off and security as if they were a party to the agreement.

11.10 Nothing in this clause limits any other rights that we and any other members of the Lloyds Banking Group may have over your assets, however such rights arise.

## 12. Corporate actions

12.1 If you ask, and where available, we will arrange for you to:
a. attend shareholders', securities holders' or unit holders' meetings (subject to any restrictions on attendance imposed by the company); and
b. vote by proxy (by telling us how you want the votes to be exercised by the nominee company). We will only use any rights we have to vote for you when you tell us to do so.
12.2 Copies of annual and half yearly reports can be requested by contacting us or by writing to Scottish Widows Unit Trust Managers Limited, 69 Morrison Street, Edinburgh EH3 1HT.
12.3 If you are entitled to extra investments (for example, through a bonus or other capitalisation issue), we will automatically arrange to hold your new investments in your account where we are able to do so.
12.4 Subject to the rest of this Condition 12, if a corporate action happens in relation to investments held in your account we will use reasonable endeavours to tell you about any rights attaching to your investments, unless we consider it impractical to do so. If you wish to participate in the corporate action, you must give us your instructions, by a method that we request, by the end of that given date. We will use reasonable endeavours to give effect to your instructions but only on such terms as you advise and as are reasonably acceptable to us. If we become aware of a corporate action at short notice, and we do not have time to obtain your instructions, or if we do not receive your instructions in time, we will select the default option that is specified by the company. Otherwise, we will take such action, or refrain from taking any action, as we, in our reasonable discretion, determine.
12.5 We may delay writing to you until the corporate action has been declared ex-entitlement or, in the case of a mandatory corporate action, until the corporate action has become effective and we have received the benefits to which you are entitled. With the exception of a compulsory acquisition we will not accept any such offer on
your behalf without your specific instructions and we will not accept instructions to accept only part of such an offer. This could mean any benefits that you were entitled to could lapse.
12.6 If we do not receive any instructions from you by a given date in respect of a compulsory acquisition, we will accept the basic terms of the acquisition on your behalf. We will write to you when this has occurred.
12.7 The terms of a corporate action may require us to make a single election on behalf of our nominee company holding in the company. If it does, we may not be able to offer clients the same choices that would have been available if the units in that company were held directly. Where possible we will use reasonable efforts to give you an option which best approximates the offer available to shareholders but we cannot guarantee that this will match the option given by the company.
12.8 Where you have indicated a wish to participate in a corporate action and our nominee company receives a distribution of entitlement to shares and any other benefits due to you arising from that corporate action, we will allocate the entitlement to your account promptly and in accordance with the regulatory requirements. Any entitlements will be rounded down to the nearest whole share or to at least two decimal places for Unit Trusts.
12.9 If the investments held in your account are subject to a corporate action which includes an offer to purchase additional units and you decide not to take up that offer, we may instruct our nominee company (as legal owner of the units) to purchase those units on our behalf. We will retain any profit (and be liable for any loss) on any future sale of those units.
12.10 Under the rules of any market, if you are selling investments through us and you receive a related benefit to which you are not entitled, you must give up this benefit to us and we will collect it and pass it on to the person entitled to it. Equally, if you are buying investments and you do not receive a related benefit to which you are entitled we will claim that benefit for you. Entitlement is established by reference to the market's 'ex-date' (that is, the date on which an investment is traded without that entitlement) and not the 'record date' (that is, the date on which it is determined that all holders shown on the register will receive a benefit). If you make a corporate action election and subsequently sell your investments, you will be liable for any

costs associated with us having to buy back those investments to honour your election. You will also be liable to pay for any loss arising from adverse movements in the share price.
12.11 Where we are required to make a corporate action call payment on your behalf, or we need to pay you a dividend, interest or a cash entitlement in a currency other than Pounds Sterling, we will make the appropriate currency conversion in accordance with Condition 9.2 and will inform you of the Pounds Sterling equivalent and when we are to transfer this from or to your account.
12.12 Additional terms apply if a corporate action occurs in relation to investments held in an ISA. These are set out at Condition 19.19.

## 13. Costs and Charges

13.1 We apply costs and charges for the service. Details of all our current costs and charges are provided to you along with these Terms and Conditions and are available online or otherwise on request.
13.2 We may change our latest published costs and charges at any time in accordance with Condition 16.
13.3 You are liable for any costs which we properly incur under this agreement, including reasonable expenses, transfers and registration fees, stamp duties, any other taxes or fiscal liabilities and any losses which we suffer if you fail to comply with your obligations under this agreement.
13.4 Additional costs and charges may be levied by the fund manager in relation to orders placed in Unit Trusts and OEICs. Any applicable costs and charges will be included within the amount payable by you or the amount you receive in respect of these investments.
13.5 You may be liable for any other taxes that arise in connection with a deal, for example Capital Gains Tax. Other costs and taxes may exist that are not paid or imposed by us. You have a responsibility to ensure you understand and adhere to personal tax obligations resulting from engaging with our products or services.
13.6 All costs and charges and any other payments due from you to us for any supply made by us are inclusive of VAT (where applicable).
13.7 When we calculate our costs and charges, we round up fractions of a penny to the nearest penny.
13.8 We may charge debit interest on unpaid amounts due to us as set out on our website from time to time.
13.9 We may collect costs and charges, interest and other costs due to us under this agreement by debiting any account that you hold with us or any member of the Lloyds Banking Group in accordance with Condition 11. This includes the right to use any money held in the account and/or arranging the sale of investments held in the account to provide funds to cover any outstanding amount.
13.10 We may restrict your account and prevent any further transaction on the account while any amounts due to us remain unpaid.
13.11 We or other members of the Lloyds Banking Group may, where regulatory requirements allow, receive or retain rebates, commissions or other benefits relating to investments and you consent to us recovering such amounts. We will provide you with further details about such arrangements as they relate to a particular deal or service before providing you with such deal or service and afterwards on request.

## 14. Information about your account

## Market information

14.1 We may send you market information and market analysis but where we do so this will not constitute investment advice and any decision to deal in investments rests with you.
14.2 We may make market information available to you as part of the services provided through our online service. Such market information is for your own personal use. You must not pass the market information on to anyone else or use it for any commercial or unlawful purpose. If you think that someone has used market information without our permission, you must notify us straight away.
14.3 If we provide market information, we use sources we believe to be reliable. If we use an independent information provider to provide market information, we will use all reasonable care and skill to choose that provider. But, because we and any provider may have limited or no control over the information sources, we cannot promise that the market information is accurate, complete, timely or in the right order. You must satisfy yourself that market information is reliable before you make any decisions or take any actions based upon it.

14.4 We are not responsible for any decision or action that you take or any loss that you or anybody else may suffer as a result of a decision or action taken on the basis of market information provided by us.
14.5 We cannot promise that the market information will always be available to you.

## Trade confirmations, valuations and statements

14.6 Information in relation to your account will be available as follows:
a. as soon as is reasonably practicable following a deal, we will send you an email stating that an online trade confirmation is available on the secure area of our online service. If you do not receive an email from us, you should not repeat your order; instead you should check the details of your deal through our secure online service; clicking on the deal reference number will display the trade confirmation details. You can also contact us for further information;
b. details of the investments and client money we hold for you will be available on the secure area of our online service. This will show the value of your investments and client money and the basis on which that value has been calculated. The valuation of your investments shown will be the latest available market price, as at the last fund valuation point;
c. all information relating to your deal(s) such as any investment plan will be available on the secure area of our online service;
d. We will provide you with a statement and valuation of investments and client money held in your account at least quarterly within the secure area of our online service. We will send an email to the email address registered with the account to tell you the statement is available. The statement will show the value of investments and the basis on which that value has been calculated. If you would like an additional statement at any time, please contact us to arrange this. We may make a charge to cover the costs to us of providing additional statements;
e. we will provide you with a statement of all costs and costs and charges you have paid on an annual basis, within the secure area of our online service; and
f. except in relation to an ISA, a consolidated tax certificate ("CTC") detailing the amount of any income received in the preceding tax year and any associated tax credit will be available to you on the secure area of our online service. It is your responsibility to keep a copy of your CTC. Requests for a duplicate CTC may incur a charge and may not be available if the original CTC is more than six tax years old.
14.7 If you wish to receive paper valuations or statements you will need to contact us to arrange this. We may make a charge to cover the costs to us of providing this.
14.8 If the online system becomes unavailable and we are unable to provide you with the relevant information online or by email:
a. we will send you a paper trade confirmation by close of business on the working day following the day on which we receive details of the deal from the fund manager. If you do not receive a trade confirmation you should not repeat your order. Instead, you should contact us for more information;
b. we will send you a paper statement and valuation of investments and client money held in your account at least quarterly. This will show the value of investments and the basis on which that value has been calculated. If you would like an additional statement at any time, please contact us to arrange this. We may make a charge to cover the costs to us of providing additional statements;

Your account will then be closed.
16.16 Until we sell the investments, they will be subject to daily price movements as normal. When we know who your personal representatives are and have proof of their authority, we will tell them the value of the investments and cash in your account on the date of your death.

## 17. Our liability, governing law, regulation and tax reporting

We will satisfy ourselves that any person to whom we delegate any functions or responsibilities under this agreement is competent to carry out those functions and responsibilities. We remain responsible under this agreement for any functions we delegate to another person (except for third party custodians to whom we delegate under Condition 10.7, in respect of which we are liable only as set out in Condition 10.7).
17.2 If we cannot perform any of our services under this agreement due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control, then we will take all reasonable steps to bring those circumstances to an end, but we will not be liable for our non-performance.

## Conflicts of interest

179 Your attention is drawn to the fact that there may be limited circumstances in which a conflict exists between your interests and those of us or our other clients. To mitigate and control these conflicts we have drawn up a conflicts of interest policy which can be found at the end of these terms and conditions.

## Tax reporting and withholding for customers subject to the tax regime of certain other countries (including the USA)

17.10 We (or other companies in the Lloyds Banking Group) may be required by legislation or by agreement with tax authorities to report certain information about you and your relationship with us, including information about your accounts:
a. to the tax authorities in the UK, which may then pass that information to the tax authorities in another country where you may be subject to tax; or
b. directly to the tax authorities in other countries (such as the USA) where we reasonably think or are required to presume you are subject to tax.
17.11 If we are required to report information about you or your relationship with us (or both), including information about your accounts, this information includes the account number, the amount of interest paid or credited to the account, the account balance or value, your name, address, country of residence, and social security number or taxpayer identification number.

17.12 In addition, we may need you to give us further information, documents or certifications about your identity, tax residence and US Citizenship status.
17.13 If we are required to report information about your accounts, you agree that:
a. you will provide additional information and documents we need from you and that confidentiality rights under relevant data protection, bank secrecy or similar laws will not apply to information we report or obtain from you to meet our obligations;
b. if you do not provide us with information or documents we need, we may
i. apply a withholding tax to amounts, including interest, we pay to you; or
ii. close your account; or
iii. transfer your account to an affiliate in another jurisdiction; and
c. we will not be liable to you for any loss you may suffer as a result of our complying with legislation or agreements with tax authorities in accordance with this condition, unless that loss is caused by our gross negligence, wilful default or fraud.

## 18. Regular monthly investments

18.1 Regular monthly investments is a feature of the service that allows you to place a standing instruction to fund your account and purchase investments on a pre-defined date each month. Regular monthly investments are executed by us in accordance with Condition 8.

## Funding Regular monthly investments

18.2 If you set up Regular monthly investments, provided that we have valid debit card details, we will automatically collect regular subscription payments from your nominated bank account according to the schedule agreed by you and us through the online service. The timetable for your Regular monthly investments is called an 'investment plan'.
18.3 Where you are funding your account using a debit card, we will usually request funds from your nominated bank account on the day specified in your investment plan or, if it is not a working day, the next working day.
18.4 You can change your instructions in relation to a regular monthly investment at any time before the working day on which the deal is due to take place.
18.5 Except where Condition 18.6 applies, we will purchase investments in accordance with your instructions once we have received your subscription amount and it becomes tradable funds. Your deal will then be executed as soon as reasonably possible during an AVP within 2 working days of us receiving tradable funds.
18.6 If we reasonably think at the time it is in your best interests and appropriate (for example, because of unusual market conditions), we can delay a regular monthly investment until such time as we think it is appropriate for us to deal on your behalf. If we delay a regular monthly investment, this will be disclosed on our website or in an email sent to you. Provided that we have acted reasonably, we shall not be liable to you for any losses that you may incur as a result of the delay.
18.7 Once we know the price of the investments to be bought in accordance with your regular monthly investment, we will calculate the number of investments to be allocated to you and allocate them to your account as soon as reasonably practicable after we have completed the relevant deal in accordance with Condition 9.

## 19. Supplementary Conditions for ISAs

19.1 The terms in this Condition 19 will apply to any account which is an ISA.

## Opening and subscribing to an ISA

19.2 You may apply for more than one account, for example for one ISA and another account that is not an ISA. In this case, the word "account" means each of those accounts and this agreement applies to each account.
19.3 In order to subscribe to your ISA:
a. Before 6th April 2024, you must not have subscribed to another stocks and shares ISA in the same tax year, unless you have transferred that ISA to us (unless Condition 19.8 applies) After 6th April 2024, you can subscribe to more than one stocks and shares ISA in the same tax year;
b. you must not have exceeded the overall subscription limit currently published by HM Revenue \& Customs. The limit that applies is detailed on our website. These limits may vary in each tax year (unless Condition 19.8 applies; and

c. you must meet the eligibility criteria in Condition 5.1 and continue to meet the residency qualification in Condition 5.1(c) at all times.

19.4 You agree to notify us immediately if you cease to meet the residency qualification in Condition 5.1(c).

19.5 Your ISA will be effective from the first date on which we have received both your ISA application and your first subscription.

19.6 You can make subscriptions to your ISA in the following ways:
a. as described in Condition 7.3; or
b. by making a transfer from another ISA as described at Conditions 19.20-19.22.

19.7 You can set up regular monthly subscriptions to your ISA if you choose. We will give you a choice of a limited number of collection dates. Provided that we have valid debit card details, we will debit funds from your nominated bank account on the collection date you select (or, if that day is not a working day, the first working day after that day). If we agree, you can change the collection date for future subscriptions.

## If an ISA holder dies

19.8 If you die, your spouse or civil partner can pay an amount up to the total value held in your ISAs into an ISA held in their own name. This amount is called an 'additional permitted subscription'. Your spouse or civil partner will not be able to use an additional permitted subscription if you are separated at the time of your death.

19.9 The additional permitted subscription will be either the value of their ISAs at the date of their death or the date the ISA is closed (including any accrued dividends, income or interest up until either date).

19.10 If a spouse or civil partner dies their ISA can remain open for a maximum of 3 years after the date of their death. During this time, no additional money can be paid into the ISA and any money withdrawn (including any withdrawals made by the account holder before death) cannot be paid back in as a replacement subscription. Withdrawals can only be made by executors during this time for specific limited reasons.

19.11 Where there is a choice to take the value of the additional permitted subscription at date of death or the date the ISA is closed, the same choice must be applied to all ISAs held with the same
provider. This means that the additional permitted subscription for these ISAs cannot be a mixture of the value on death of the account holder and the value at date of closure. If you choose to calculate the additional permitted subscription when the ISAs are closed, you will only be able to take advantage of your additional permitted subscription when all of the ISAs held with the same provider have been closed. You can ask for a different date (either the date of death or the ISA closure date) to be used for ISAs held with different providers. Once you have told a provider whether you will use the date of death or the ISA closure date, you cannot change your mind.

19.12 If a spouse or civil partner chooses to take the value of the deceased's ISA when it is closed, the additional permitted subscription allowance will never be lower than the value of the ISA at the date of death (but it may be higher). But, if a spouse or civil partner chooses to take the value of the deceased's ISA at the date of their death, this amount cannot be increased later.

19.13 Where a spouse or civil partner dies and we receive notice to close their ISA, we will transfer the stock and or cash held in the account as per the executor's instructions. If we do not receive notice to close an ISA following the death of the account holder, the account will stop qualifying as an ISA 3 years from the date of death.

19.14 Non-cash assets (i.e. stocks and shares) can also be used as part of an additional permitted subscription where:

- The surviving spouse/civil partner has inherited, from their deceased spouse/civil partner, the assets which were held in the ISA; and
- The assets were held in the ISA at the date the ISA manager was notified of the death of the investor; and
- Title has not moved from that ISA manager or their nominee; and
- The surviving spouse/civil partner will retain the same ISA Manager as the deceased.

If any (or all) of these do not apply, the subscription must be made in cash. Transfer of the non-cash assets must be made within 180 days of beneficial ownership passing to the surviving spouse.

19.15 Additional permitted subscriptions do not count as part of your yearly ISA allowance. When the time comes to use your additional permitted subscription, you must pay it into your ISA within

the time-limits set out in the ISA Regulations. We will tell you about these time-limits when you make an additional permitted subscription. You can pay some or all of an additional permitted subscription into your Stocks and Shares ISA by contacting us to request an application form or to transfer money from another internal account.

## Investments you can hold in your ISA

19.16 The ISA investments must be and remain in your beneficial ownership and must not be used as security for a loan.
19.17 Title to the investments and client money held in your ISA will be registered in accordance with Condition 10. Share certificates and other documents evidencing title to investments will be held by us as ISA Manager or as we may direct.
19.18 If there are insufficient tradable funds in your ISA to support a corporate action and you have already reached your subscription limit for the tax year, you can obtain tradable funds by selling investments held in your ISA and use these funds to meet the amount that is due. You can subscribe additional cleared funds to your account to meet the amount due, subject to the annual subscription limit for your ISA. We may (at our discretion) in limited circumstances, after receipt of a request by you, give you the option to take up the corporate action outside the ISA.
19.19 If, as a result of a corporate action, we receive investments which are not 'qualifying investment' for a stocks and shares ISA under the ISA Regulations, we may offer you the option of selling the investments and using the sale proceeds to purchase investments in your ISA. We will notify you if this option is available to you. We may charge for these services as set out here.
19.20 If you ask, and where available, we will arrange for you to:
a. attend shareholders', securities holders' or unit holders' meetings (subject to any restrictions on attendance imposed by the company); and
b. vote by proxy (by telling us how you want the votes to be exercised by the nominee company). We will only use any rights we have to vote for you when you tel us to do so.
19.21 Copies of annual and half yearly reports can be requested by contacting us or by writing to Scottish Widows Unit Trust Managers Limited, 69 Morrison Street, Edinburgh EH3 1HT.

## Transferring an ISA from another ISA Manager

19.22 We will accept a transfer of cash (but not investments) from a cash ISA, stocks and shares ISA, lifetime ISA or innovative finance ISA held with another ISA Manager to us.
19.23 You should contact us in writing or by telephone and we will send you a transfer form to complete. Alternatively, you can download the transfer form from our website.
19.24 Once you have completed and returned the form we will contact your existing ISA manager to arrange the transfer. Your account must be open before we can accept the transfer. The value of your investments may fall during the period that the transfer is taking place. You will bear that market risk.

## Transferring your ISA to another ISA Manager

19.25 You can, at any time, subject to a reasonable business period not exceeding 30 calendar days for the practical implementation of your instructions by us, transfer:
a. all of your current tax year's subscriptions, the value of investments bought with those subscriptions, and any income arising on those investments; and/or
b. some or all of your previous tax years' subscriptions, the value of investments bought with those subscriptions, and any income arising on those investments.
19.26 You can do this by applying to the ISA manager to whom you wish to make the transfer. They will provide you with a transfer form and will arrange the transfer with us. The value of your investments may fall during the period that the transfer is taking place. You will bear that market risk. We will sell your investments before we make the transfer, and will transfer the available funds to the new ISA manager.
19.27 Where your ISA has been transferred to another ISA manager and we receive dividends, interest or other income on your behalf we will send this income to the new ISA manager except where the amount is less than $£ 50$ when we will send this income directly to you.
19.28 If you ask us to transfer all of your previous and current years' subscriptions from your ISA, we will close your ISA as described at Condition 19.35 below.

## Withdrawals

19.29 You can make withdrawals from your ISA in the same ways as for any other account. However, withdrawing amounts will not increase your subscription limit, and you may not be able to pay amounts withdrawn back into your ISA within the same tax year.

## Your ISA's tax status

19.30 Under the current law relating to tax relief for ISAs, we will manage your ISA so that it will be free from UK Income Tax and Capital Gains Tax. When these terms and conditions refer to tax relief, they mean the tax relief that applies at the date of publication of these terms and conditions in the UK. Tax relief could change in the future. If the tax relief that applies to ISAs changes, your ISA will continue but it will be affected by that change. We do not claim relief on tax levied outside the UK.
On death the ISA tax efficient status can continue until the earliest of your account being closed, the date the administration of your estate is completed or three years from the date of your death. If you are married or in a civil partnership and you have not separated from your spouse or civil partner as at the date of your death, it is possible for you to leave the investments in your ISA to your spouse or civil partner in a way which allows them to continue to benefit from the favourable tax treatment of your ISA. In these circumstances and provided the requirements of the ISA Regulations are met, your spouse or civil partner will then be entitled, if they wish, to transfer the investments in your ISA into an ISA in their own name rather than having to subscribe by way of cash for their additional permitted subscription.

## Communication with HM Revenue \& Customs

19.31 We will give HM Revenue \& Customs information about your ISA as required by regulatory requirements.
19.32 If we have passed any tax to you that you are not entitled to, we can deduct this amount from your ISA and repay HM Revenue \& Customs.
19.33 Where we are required to account to HM Revenue \& Customs for any tax arising from any dividends, interest payments and cash entitlements paid on investments in your ISA, you authorise us to collect this tax out of any cash that we hold for you in your ISA or, if you do not hold sufficient cash, by selling investments from your ISA.

## Void ISAs

19.34 Under the ISA Regulations, we must notify you if, by any reason of any failure to satisfy the provisions of the ISA Regulations, an ISA has or will become void and will no longer benefit from the tax relief that applies to ISAs. We will tell you to contact your HM Revenue \& Customs office with details of your potentially void ISA. Alternatively, HM Revenue \& Customs may tell us that your ISA is void. In some circumstances we may be able to allow your ISA to continue, but there may be a charge for this.

## Delegating our functions as ISA Manager

19.35 We may delegate any of our functions or responsibilities as ISA Manager in accordance with Condition 17.1.

## Closing your ISA

19.36 You can close your ISA as set out in Condition 16.1.
19.37 We can close your ISA as set out in Condition 16.2, 16.3, 16.4 or if:
a. under the ISA Regulations, your ISA becomes void, or we are required to close it by HM Revenue \& Customs;
b. the value of your ISA falls below $£ 250$, we have notified you, and you have not made any further subscriptions within 60 days of that notification; or
c. If our appointment as ISA Manager is ended for whatever reason, we have given you at least 30 calendar days' notice that we intend to end your ISA and of your right to transfer your ISA to another ISA manager, and you have not so transferred your ISA within 60 days of that notification.
19.38 If we or you close your ISA, we will give you certain options. Costs and charges may apply, please see our website for details. We will:
a. on your instructions and within the time limit stipulated by you in your instructions (subject to a reasonable business period not exceeding 30 calendar days for the practical implementation of your instructions by us), sell the ISA investments and transfer the available funds (less any costs and charges or other amounts you owe us) with all rights and obligations direct to another ISA manager as described at Conditions 19.23-19.26 above; or

b. on your instructions and within the time limit stipulated by you, sell the investments held in the ISA and pay to your nominated bank account the net sale proceeds arising from those investments and any other cash we were holding for you in the ISA (less any costs and charges and other money that you owe us).

# ORDER EXECUTION POLICY

Lloyds Bank e-Investments
![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

LLOYDS BANK

# Our approach to order execution

We're committed to treating our customers fairly. We will provide the information you need to help you make informed decisions about your investments. One way we do this is to explain how we will handle your investment instructions. Further details are contained in our terms and conditions ${ }^{1}$.

## We'll try to complete your order in the following way

We always want to get the best results when completing a buy or sell order for you. To do this, we rely on state-of-the-art technology for routing, completing and monitoring orders.

## Trading

When you select to invest into funds, and your account has been funded, the system will produce your order to invest in your chosen fund. This order will then be routed to the fund manager. Dependent on the time the order is placed this will normally be the next working day, however in some cases this can take up to two working days.

The funds are priced on a daily basis and your order will be executed at the next available price point. Upon execution the fund manager will advise us of the details and these will be updated online. This can take up to two working days, but we will usually have these details the next working day.

When you sell all or part of your investment our system will produce your order and send it to the fund manger. This order will then be executed at the next available price point and the fund manager will advise us of the details, at which point you will be able to view these
online. This can take up to two working days, but we will usually have these details the next working day. Upon completion of the order with the fund manager, money will automatically be returned to your nominated bank account. This process may take up to 10 working days.

Whether you are buying or selling your investment, you will be able to view the contract note and a bargain reference for your order, online. This is available when we have received the details from the fund manager, as explained above. After three working days from the price point the trade will settle, meaning that money and units in the fund will move between the fund manager and your account. At this point the order is complete and, if you are a seller, the process to return money to your nominated bank account will begin.

## Regular review of completed orders and order execution policy

To maintain our high standards we regularly evaluate the overall quality of completed orders. If a process can be improved, we'll do what we can to make it happen.

We also review our Order Execution Policy at least once a year to make sure we get the best results overall for our customers. If we make any changes to our policy we'll put this revised document on our website. Any material changes will be dealt with in accordance with our terms and conditions.

# CONFLICTS OF INTEREST POLICY

# Conflicts of Interest Policy

A 'conflict of interest' is a situation where a firm, one of its employees or anyone else involved in its running, has conflicting personal and professional interests. This could get in the way of us providing independent and impartial services.

We are committed to treating our customers fairly and do all we can to identify and manage any actual and potential conflicts of interest that may arise. We always try to avoid putting ourselves in a position where there could be any conflict between our interest and our customers' interests. However, we recognise that conflicts of interest may arise.

This leaflet explains how we prevent and manage conflicts of interest and make sure that we treat our customers fairly. We've listed the main potential conflicts and how we manage them below.

## What is classed as a conflict?

A conflict could arise if Lloyds Bank e-Investments or anyone connected to them:

- is likely to make a financial gain, or avoid a financial loss, at the expense of a customer;
- has an interest in the outcome of a service provided to a customer;
- has an interest in the outcome of a transaction carried out on behalf of a customer;
- has a financial or other incentive to favour the interest of a customer or group of customers over the interests of another customer;
- carries on the same business as a customer;
- receives, or will receive an inducement in relation to a service provided to a customer, in the form of monies, goods or services (this does not include usual commission or other service charged to customers).


## Lloyds Banking Group Connections

## What's the conflict of interest?

The Lloyds Bank e-Investments Service is part of Lloyds Banking Group and it's possible that the Group's decisions or strategy could lead to a conflict of interest for our customers if they have a significant impact on us.

## How do we manage this?

The Lloyds Bank e-Investments Service is operated by Halifax Share Dealing Limited, which is a separate legal and regulated entity to Lloyds Banking Group, and has a separate

Board of Directors who are approved and regulated by the FCA. They have ongoing training and development to make sure they act independently and understand their responsibilities.

## Employee Rewards and Payment

## What's the conflict of interest?

Incentive schemes could encourage staff to favour certain transactions or investment types, or influence how complaints are dealt with.

## How do we manage this?

We don't offer incentive schemes or pay commission to staff. Instead, their performance is measured on how well they look after customers, meet compliance requirements and act in line with our values.

## Gifts and Other Inducements

## What's the conflict of interest?

Gifts, entertainment, hospitality and other inducements could influence staff to choose a particular supplier rather than acting in customers' best interests. We sometimes receive modest non-monetary benefits from product providers or other third parties, including the provision of literature or participation in training and seminars. We may also occasionally receive gifts from customers and suppliers.

## How do we manage this?

We take care to make sure that any gifts or other benefits are modest and are recorded and monitored.

## Personal Conflicts

## What's the conflict of interest?

If our staff, or any of their close family or friends, hold positions of responsibility in other companies, staff may prioritise their interests over those of our customers.

Close links with other companies could also influence staff to choose them as suppliers over others who might offer a better service for customers.

Staff may also have personal relationships with customers, and prioritise their complaints or claims over those of other customers.

## How do we manage this?

We train staff to make sure they understand their obligations. We check to make sure that staff don't have any undisclosed and unapproved relationships with suppliers, customers, colleagues or competitors that might get in the way of their independent judgement and stop them acting in customers' best interests. We also segregate duties, which means that staff have separate roles and responsibilities so any activities cannot be carried out without supervision and monitoring.

We also restrict and carefully control how confidential information that could cause a conflict is shared across the business.

## Personal Account Dealing

## What's the conflict of interest?

Staff working at The Lloyds Bank e-Investments Service can have their own accounts and use these to trade. They could trade ahead of customers for their own benefit, which could disadvantage customers.

## How do we manage this?

We have a detailed Personal Account Dealing policy and any transactions by staff on their own accounts must be carried out in accordance with this policy. These are monitored by our Compliance department who check to make sure that personal account transactions haven't affected customer orders.

## Customer Disclosure

If we identify any relationship or potential conflict of interest that can't be mitigated, we will disclose that conflict of interest before acting for that customer.

This disclosure will be in made in writing to the customer.

## Summary

After careful review we firmly believe that we have taken all necessary steps to manage or mitigate any potential conflicts of interest that could affect you.

We will continue to review this policy on a regular basis.
