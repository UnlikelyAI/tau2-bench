# HOW SAFE ARE MY ASSETS?

## Direct Investments

## How do you keep my assets safe?

We protect your cash and investments in two ways - by keeping them separate from our own (known as segregation) and by being part of the FSCS, or Financial Services Compensation Scheme.

## Segregation of assets

In simple terms, this means keeping your cash and assets separate to ours, so we know exactly what belongs to you. This means that if we were to stop trading, your cash and assets could be returned to you.

Stock: we register all customer stock we hold in the name of a nominee company. This is a non-trading company and the record of accounts clearly identifies which stocks are held on behalf of customers.

Cash: all client money is held in bank accounts that are only used for holding client money. This clearly keeps client money accounts separate from accounts we use for our own money.

If you have chosen the Individual Client Segregation Service then please see the "How we hold your assets at a Central Securities Depository (CSD)" document which sets out further details on how we keep your assets safe. This can be found at www.lloydsbank.com/ics-service

Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS)
If we stopped trading and these segregation arrangements didn't work, customers classed as retail clients would be able to claim up to $Â£ 85,000$ through the FSCS.

This limit applies to the total of all stock and cash you hold across the four share dealing businesses we look after; Lloyds Bank Direct Investments, Halifax Share Dealing, IWeb Share Dealing and Bank of Scotland Share Dealing. So if you had a Lloyds Bank Direct Investments Share Dealing ISA and an IWeb Share Dealing Account, then the value of your assets in both accounts would be viewed together by the FSCS.

You can find out more about the FSCS at www.fscs.org.uk
